While its models offer potential advantages in performance and accessibility via open weights, the associated security and privacy concerns, particularly with its direct services, are substantial. Responsible enterprise adoption necessitates a clear-eyed assessment of these risks and a commitment to implementing rigorous technical controls and governance frameworks, strongly favoring carefully secured local deployments over reliance on the company's cloud infrastructure for any sensitive operations.", "metadata": {"source_md": "Deepseek AI_ Local Deployment Analysis_.md", "heading_hierarchy": "IX.
