However, alongside the remarkable advancements in natural language processing, concerns about user privacy and data security have become prominent challenges that need immediate attention. In response to these critical concerns, this article presents a novel approach that addresses the privacy and security issues in chatbot applications. We propose a secure and privacy-preserving framework for chatbot systems by leveraging the power of decentralised federated learning (DFL) and secure multi-party computation (SMPC). Our DFL framework leverages blockchain smart contracts for participant selection, orchestrating the training process on user data while keeping the data local, and model distribution. After each round of local training by the participants, the blockchain network securely aggregates the model updates using SMPC, ensuring that participants’ raw model parameters are not exposed to others. The global model is encrypted and stored in hypermedia protocols such as the InterPlanetary File System. Participants decrypt the global model updates using their private keys to further fine-tune their models. Iterative training rounds are executed through the blockchain network, with participants updating the model collaboratively using SMPC. Experiments show that our approach achieves comparable performance to centralised models while offering significant improvements in privacy and security. This article presents a ground-breaking solution to privacy and security challenges in chatbots, and we hope our approach will foster trust and encourage broader adoption of chatbot technology with privacy at the forefront.

Introduction Despite the significant privacy advantages offered by FL, centralised FL implementations still pose certain threats. A centralised FL setup Natural language processing (NLP) and Large language models (LLMs) introduces the possibility of a single point of failure, where the central have recently revolutionised human–computer interaction [1]. Advanced server becomes vulnerable to attacks, potentially compromising the privacy LLMs such as ChatGPT by OpenAI have shown their potential to transform of users. Additionally, model privacy concerns arise as the central server various industries and automate language tasks on an unprecedented scale might have access to aggregated model updates from various users, raising [2]. However, this surge in useful applications has also raised significant the risk of information leakage or even malicious central servers as an concerns about privacy, trust, and user data exploitation [3]. As these extreme example [6]. As such, striking the right balance between leveraging LLMs process large amounts of user data for training and fine-tuning, it the benefits of FL’s privacy-preserving capabilities and mitigating the is essential to address the potential risks associated with unauthorised data challenges of centralised deployment remains a crucial area of research access, breaches, and misuse.

[4], is a technologies [10]. This approach mitigates the risks associated with a single promising solution for preserving user privacy, especially in the context point of failure by leveraging the decentralised and distributed nature of of NLP technologies [5]. FL enables model training by distributing the blockchain networks. In blockchain-based FL, or decentralised federated learning process across individual user devices, thereby avoiding the need learning (DFL), participants (nodes) collaborate directly on the blockchain, to centralise sensitive data on a single server. This approach keeps user data contributing their encrypted model updates while maintaining control over localised, encrypted, and under the user’s control, ensuring that no raw their individual data [11]. The tamper-resistant nature of blockchain ensures personal information is exposed during the training process. By aggregating data integrity and prevents unauthorised access, offering a more secure and model updates from multiple users without sharing their individual data, privacy-preserving environment. Moreover, the use of blockchain smart FL enhances privacy protection and minimises the risk of data breaches contracts for aggregating model updates enables transparent and trustless and unauthorised access. computations without compromising individual The JBBA | Volume 7 | Issue 1 | May 2024 24", "metadata": {"source_file": "jbba_scholasticahq_com_120287.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/jbba_scholasticahq_com_120287.pdf", "page_number": 24, "chunk_id": "jbba_scholasticahq_com_120287_p24_c1", "creationDate": "D:20240423171657+01'00'"}}

This to revolutionise the chatbot landscape by instilling user confidence and adaptability allows blockchain-based DFL to optimise its performance reinforcing the protection of sensitive information throughout the FL while maintaining its privacy-preserving attributes. process. Figure 1 showcases the differences between a centralised and a decentralised process and highlights the key differences in the setup, which Thirdly, blockchain-based DFL faces the challenge of selecting a suitable is the blockchain infrastructure orchestrating the processing of FL instead model evaluation mechanism without compromising on security. We address of a central server. this by ensuring differential privacy-enabled models [13] are used for peer evaluation and subsequently rewarding users for their participation in the evaluation phase, instead of users allowing access to raw model parameters that may potentially expose the training data via inversion attacks. A related issue is how to perform the model aggregation for the FL process at the end of each epoch without exposing the models of each user. To this end, we implement secure multi-party computation (SMPC) techniques to enable collaborative model aggregation across multiple participants [14]. SMPC can let multiple users combine their private models without knowing each other’s inputs. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce this for blockchain-based FL [11]. Finally, deploying LLMs locally for privacy-preserving DFL chatbot applications is challenging because they require a lot of computational power, especially during inference tasks. LLMs, such as GPT-4, have shown impressive language-generation capabilities, but their large size and complexity require powerful hardware resources for efficient real-time performance [15]. Local deployment on resource-constrained devices can result in slow response times, increased latency, and potential memory constraints, which can hinder the seamless user experience that is critical for chatbot interactions. Similarly, fully homomorphic encryption-enabled LLMs increase the latency while trying to preserve user privacy [16]. Additionally, the continuous evolution of LLMs with ongoing updates and improvements requires consistent access to the latest model versions, which may be impractical to maintain locally. As a result, striking a balance between leveraging the capabilities of LLMs and the computational constraints of local deployment is a critical consideration for achieving optimal performance in chatbot applications. One way to address the challenges of deploying LLMs locally for DFL applications is to limit the chatbot’s functionality and embrace Tiny Language Models (TinyLMs) [17]. TinyLMs are smaller versions of LLMs that have been optimised for specific tasks or domains, reducing the model size and computational requirements without sacrificing much performance. By using TinyLMs that are tailored to the specific needs of the application, one can achieve a more lightweight and responsive deployment, making it feasible to run the chatbot on resource-constrained Figure 1. Centralised vs decentralised federated learning. devices. This strategic use of TinyLMs allows chatbot developers to strike a balance between offering valuable language processing capabilities and ensuring a smooth user experience without the burden of deploying Firstly, blockchain-based DFL offers promising solutions to user privacy unwieldy LLMs locally. concerns in chatbot applications, but it also introduces specific challenges that need to be carefully considered, as discussed in this latest survey In summary, by combining the power of blockchain-based DFL with the article [11]. One of the main challenges is the scalability and latency generation of TinyLMs, we present a novel framework that revolutionises of blockchain networks. Because DFL involves multiple participants how language models are trained and deployed. Notably, our contribution performing computations and sharing model updates on the blockchain, extends beyond conventional methods by being among the first to the sheer volume of data and transactions may result in slower processing implement SMPC in the context of DFL. This innovation ensures that times and increased network congestion. InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) participants’ data remains confidential during the collaborative model [12] can be adopted to address scalability and latency concerns. IPFS allows aggregation process, enhancing the privacy and security of the overall participants to store models without explicitly relying on the blockchain system. In addition, the generation of TinyLMs through fine-tuning, infrastructure, making it an ideal solution for model communication and distillation, and quantisation enables the creation of efficient language storage in DFL. The storage burden is distributed across participants with models suitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices. The next IPFS, which alleviates the scalability issues faced by a central server or the section details our framework, Section 3 demonstrates the effectiveness of blockchain network itself. our approach, and, finally, the article is concluded in Section 4.

It is important to note that the main contribution of the article is the DFL framework itself, and the distilled models are typically expected to have slightly lower performance model used is only for showcasing our successful implementation. than their teacher models, but the student model is much faster and more efficient. Quantisation was then applied to the distilled TinyLM to further compress the model’s weights, achieving a more computationally feasible model without sacrificing performance (e.g., 8-bit integers instead of 32-bit floating-point numbers). In this work, we used relevant low-precision optimisers [22] and QLoRA [19] to obtain the fine-tuned quantised student model.

The TinyLM currently exhibits baseline proficiency in text summarisation tasks and a compact footprint that permits execution on standard end-user devices, such as a personal PC with a Graphics processing unit (GPU). The initial global model for five separate DFL nodes is established using the deployed TinyLM. These nodes possess private data for training, achieved by dividing the training dataset into five distinct segments, with each segment assigned to a respective node. Subsequently, each of these five nodes proceeds to conduct fine-tuning operations using its private data and subsequently evaluate the model’s performance. The resulting fine-tuned private models are subjected to encrypted aggregation, facilitating the preservation of data privacy while also enabling parallel fine-tuning processes. This approach not only facilitates the utilisation of sensitive private data without compromising privacy but also harnesses individual computational resources to do the parallel training to expedite the model training process.

It emphasises the critical importance of maintaining product integrity, safety, and quality throughout the process to meet stringent regulatory standards and consumer expectations. However, food supply chain is plagued by challenges such as counterfeiting, quality issues, and safety concerns, prompting the adoption of product traceability as a remedy. Current traceability systems (e.g., systems based on centralised and EPCIS architectures) aim to capture traceability data from the initial link to the final link in the supply chain, allowing for tracing a product from the end consumer back to its origin. Nevertheless, trust issues persist in these systems, particularly concerning the integrity and reliability of traceability data. Blockchain has been proposed to address these trust issues by creating an immutable and transparent ledger distributed across all peers. Despite this innovation, different studies underscore the inadequacy of relying solely on blockchain to ensure the trustworthiness of traceability data. This paper addresses this gap by proposing an adaptable and extensible framework that combines blockchain with a multi-trust packages-based trust model. The framework seeks to strengthen trust relationships among supply chain actors by improving the accuracy of identifying specific areas within the supply chain where compromises in quality and safety have occurred.

Introduction with the blockchain approach. This is because blockchain does not have the capability to correct faulty and malicious data from the source to the Several scandals and recalls resulting from quality and safety compromise, ledger. To address the GIGO problem, Malik et al. [22], Dedeoglu et al. [21], as well as product counterfeiting, have been reported from supply chains and Al-Rakhami and Al-Mashari [23] proposed approaches that integrate around the world [1–4]. Many lives have been lost due to quality and safety blockchain and trust model, referred to in this study as blockchain + trust compromise problems. For example, regarding food supply chains, the model approach. In this approach, the trust model’s role is to establish World Health Organisation reported that an estimated 600 million people trust in the ecosystem by computing the degree of trust (trust score) and become sick because of consuming food products and 420,000 end up associating the score with the network participants and data, while the dying [5]. This has resulted in many consumers losing trust in supply blockchain provides tamper-proof repository. To develop trust models, chains. To address this issue, several studies have suggested end-to-end trust metrics (TMs) are used. TMs are vital in determining whether a trust traceability [6–8]. End-to-end traceability can provide an audit trail in model accurately computes trust [24, 25]. the movement of a product in the supply chain [9], which helps detect quality and safety issues at the early stages of the supply chain [10]. It also In blockchain + trust model frameworks, a single set of TMs is used makes product recalls to be managed systematically [11] and shortens the to quantify and compute trust scores. Using trust models that rely on a time taken to trace and pinpoint exactly where the product might have single TMs set to solve the trust problem is less effective because (1) as been compromised [12]. In food and pharmaceutical supply chains, many traceability data is generated by different data sources in different supply governments have taken the initiative to make traceability a legal obligation chain links, different sets of trust metrics are required to quantify trust to protect consumers [13, 14]. values effectively; (2) whenever there are changes in the supply chain trust needs (e.g., new data produced in the supply chain), the framework’s degree To support traceability processes in supply chains, automated traceability of accuracy in estimating trust score becomes low. This is because new systems are being used. These traceability systems can store traceability data trust requirements need different metrics to accurately compute trust. We in centralised repositories [15] or in repositories using distributed ledger agree with the views of other researchers that the problem can be solved by technologies such as blockchain [16–19]. Centralised traceability systems addressing the data trust problem [26, 8, 20, 21]. Therefore, our approach provide non-tamper-proof data repositories. However, repositories is to develop a framework that improves the end-to-end trustworthiness of whose data can be tampered with have data trust problems, as nothing traceability data by assessing the trustworthiness of traceability data and stops the parties from tampering with the data to favour their interests storing both data and associated trust values in a tamper-proof repository.

Trust and trustworthiness are two concepts used in the 2. Related work development of trust models. Trust is drawn from human life and, as Sagar et al. [24] highlighted, “It is a fundamental aspect of human life for The literature presents several frameworks that attempt to address the building relationships with each other.” Research in trust cuts across various problem of data trust. The frameworks can be categorised into three disciplines, such as psychology [34, 35], sociology [36, 37], economics [38, based on their architectural designs [8]. These include centralised [15, 27], 39], and computer science [40–46]. What is common in all the disciplines is blockchain [28], and blockchain + trust model [21]. that there is a trustor and trustee. The trustee makes a promise by sharing information, and the trustor accepts to rely on the information that the In a centralised architecture, data from the supply chain is sent to a trustee will fulfil the promise. Computer science has multiple domains centralised repository mainly hosted in wide area networks. Some systems where the concept of trust is applied. These include software engineering use one central repository, while others have distributed repositories. [40], networking [41], data trust [42, 43], artificial intelligence [44], and web Electronic Product Code Information Service (EPCIS) is an example of a management [45, 46]. In these areas, trust is associated with the trustor and distributed centralised repositories network. EPCIS network has an extra it is the behaviour displayed by the trustor based on the trustworthiness repository called Discovery Service, whose function is to route the data of the trustee. Thus, trustworthiness is a characteristic displayed by the requests from traceability applications to the right EPCIS data servers and trustee. re-route the queried data back to the requesting traceability applications. Central repositories are managed by intermediaries in the supply chain [29, Our focus in this research is on addressing trust in traceability data for 15]. Whenever traceability is needed, the central data repository is queried supply chains. Accordingly, trust models are built to mathematically quantify by traceability systems to acquire the data used for tracing the product. trustworthiness in a particular domain and context [47]. In the existing Traceability in this approach is solely dependent on the central data trust models, the quantified value is the measure of the trustworthiness of repositories. In all traceability systems based on a centralised architecture, the trustee. It is mostly referred to as the trust score. Trust models typically intermediaries can tamper with the data and, hence, do not adequately normalise trust scores to fall between 0 and 1. 0 implies no trust at all, address data trust issues in the supply chain [21, 22, 26, 48]. while 1 means full trust. Low trust values are those near 0, and high trust values are those near 1. In blockchain architecture, traceability data from the supply chain is evaluated for validity by a consensus mechanism and, if valid, then passed Few frameworks have been observed in the literature developed using this into an immutable ledger. However, one of the drawbacks with the current approach. These include Malik et al. [22], Al-Rakhami and Al-Mashari [23], blockchain consensus mechanism is that it cannot verify data veracity [20, Dedeoglu [21], and Rouhani and Deters [48]. Malik et al. [22] suggested 21]. The merits of this approach lie in the following: (1) there is a high trust metrics for generating trust scores that measure the level of quality level of transparency as nodes can always see data from other peers, which and safety of the product. This means that a trust score close to 1 implies many researchers claim it encourages nodes to be honest. It should be high quality and safety of the product. However, the framework does not noted that transparency is observed at different levels depending on the adequately address the trust problem in traceability data. The IoT devices type of blockchain. In public blockchains, the same ledger is visible to are vulnerable to data security compromise [60]. This is because: (1) the all members; therefore, transparency is guaranteed to all members of the devices are heavily dependent on batteries for power supply, which makes blockchain, while in consortium and private blockchains, transparency is them vulnerable to energy-depletion attacks [61]; (2) the devices have a at the group members level (those with common ledger). For example, in limited amount of memory and processing power, incapable of running the Hyperledger Fabric consortium blockchain, transparency is limited to complex cryptographic security algorithms [62]. Since IoT devices are those within the same cluster. In this study, transparency is discussed in vulnerable to so many security attacks, there is no guarantee that the data the context of consortium blockchains featuring a shared ledger among from the devices used by the framework to calculate trust scores is not members; (2) immutability of data once in the ledger. malicious. Different researchers have proposed frameworks using this architecture. To Al-Rakhami and Al-Mashari [23] and Rouhani and Deters’ [48] frameworks control the distribution of counterfeit products in pharmaceutical supply attempt to assess trust in the data using blockchain + trust model chains, Kumar and Tripathi [31] developed a traceability system that uses approach. The problem with the frameworks is the use of one set of trust blockchain technology and quick response (QR) code. In their traceability metrics. A supply chain comprises a consortium that contributes to and system, the encrypted QR code consists of the details of the medicine that records various traceability data for a product. The consortium uses diverse a pharmaceutical company manufactures, and the information is stored in data sources and using one set of trust metrics by these frameworks is a the immutable ledger. In agri-food supply chains, Lin et al. [32] integrated bottleneck in accurately assessing the trustworthiness of traceability data. blockchain and Long-Range Radio (LoRa) IoT-based architecture and For example, if there is a supply chain link that uses GPS devices to send demonstrated that minimising manual data entry by humans improves location data about a product and another supply chain link that uses trust in food supply chains. A similar approach was also proposed by Tan, temperature and humidity sensors to capture data about the environmental Gligor, and Ngah [33], who developed a traceability system using blockchain conditions of the perishable products storage, using a single set of trust technology for tracing and confirming the authenticity of halal products. metrics cannot accurately assess data from GPS devices and environmental Similarly, Walmart piloted a blockchain traceability system on mango and condition sensory data. Thus, using one set of trust metrics is limited in pork supply chains, showing that traceability can be reduced from seven computing accurate trust scores. days to 2.2 seconds [19]. The blockchain approach provides the advantages of transparency, immutable ledger, and consensus mechanism that filter 3. Adaptive and extensible framework invalid data from entering the ledger.

The Botswana beef supply chain currently uses a centralised traceability Trust computation smart contract uses the trust package to compute trust system called Botswana Animal Identification and Traceability System and send the data and trust score to the ledger. The data repositories (BAITS) [54, 55]. consist of two main ledgers: the metrics ledger shaded green and the base ledger shaded grey. The base ledger stores traceability data and trust scores. This protects data and trust scores from tampering. Metrics ledger, on the other hand, stores different trust packages. TMs are protected in the ledger because of their criticality for accurately assessing trust scores. Metrics developers continuously assess the effectiveness of existing trust packages, and if some are seen to be less effective, then they develop new trust packages to replace them. Also, if new data generators generate data that none of the existing packages can assess for trust, then metrics developers develop trust packages to address those trust needs. This makes the framework to be more effective and relevant. The application module provides an interface between the blockchain ledger and end-user applications.

Trust packages development We used the guidelines provided by Leteane and Ayalew [25] to identify trust metrics and use them to develop trust packages for the Botswana beef supply chain. For demonstration purposes, trust packages for farm and cold room links are developed. 5.1 Trust at the farm link Trust issues mainly emerge from free-range farming because it is difficult to monitor the location of the cattle. Botswana has different zones to identify areas affected by diseases such as foot and mouth disease (FMD). One of the major requirements of the EU market is that all meat products should be coming from disease-free zones. Assuring the markets that the cattle come from free-range farming has never passed through the FMD zones remains a big challenge. Collecting real-time data of cattle movement using IoT devices in this supply chain would be ideal. Nevertheless, the integrity and truthiness of the data from IoT devices could be compromised, Figure 1. Framework for enhancing trust in supply chain resulting in data trust problems.

TPSC uses algorithm 1 to compute the trust score for battery-level trust metrics. 5.2 Trust at the cold room links The computation is based on Equations (2)–(4). Algorithm 2 computes trust score for the calibration trust metrics. TPSC uses the algorithm to IoT temperature and humidity sensors are used to collect and forward the get the trust score for the metrics and is used in computing the total trust data to the framework.

A lack of transparency often pervades these systems, which may result in an increased likelihood of fraudulent and corrupt activity. Additionally, traceability pertaining to recycled materials frequently proves inadequate. Together, these inefficiencies in the collection and processing of recyclables can lead to higher costs and environmental impact. Furthermore, low incentives may deter individuals and businesses from participating in recycling initiatives. Certain recycling systems may also suffer from limited compatibility with specific materials, further reducing their effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose a permissioned Ethereum blockchain-based system that aims to incentivise and encourage recycling practices in a transparent and secure manner. The platform’s modular and multi-layered design makes it adaptable to various recycling scenarios, allowing it to handle diverse types of recyclable materials. Automated and streamlined recycling processes are achieved through the use of smart contracts. The proposed system offers a secure, transparent, and efficient platform for the management of recycling processes, promoting environmentally responsible behaviour towards a circular economy. Potential applications for the system include waste disposal and recycling management for smart cities, waste management for organisations, and tracking and management of operations for recycling companies. The platform is highly versatile and can accommodate various use cases in the recycling industry, including those involving traceable and untraceable materials, as well as individual and corporate use cases.

To maintain security, the private key must be kept confidential and not shared with unauthorised individuals. In order to provide access to the client’s records within the blockchain, the wallet generates a public cryptographic key, derived from the private key. This public key is then transmitted to the node, granting it permission to access the client’s records. The lifespan of the public key is determined by a time limit set within the wallet system, which can be altered based on the client’s specifications and expires after a predetermined interval.

Those are clients that collect, process, and sell recyclable materials, such as paper, plastic, glass, and metal, to manufacturers that use these materials to make new products.

In a traditional transaction, a singular clients for recyclable items. The blockchain promotes accountability and party initiates the transaction, affixes their digital signature using the sustainability by tracking both purchased and recycled items. Hence, as corresponding private key, and subsequently broadcasts the transaction into mentioned earlier, in our system every client has two distinct records: one the blockchain. However, in a multisignature scheme, multiple parties are for purchased items and the other for recycled items. To illustrate, consider required to sign the transaction before it can be verified and added to the the scenario where a client wishes to recycle a previously purchased item. blockchain.

The implementation of multisignature ensures that every eventual inclusion in the client’s record in the blockchain (Figure 5). transaction necessitates approval from a minimum of two parties, thereby augmenting the system’s security and transparency – for instance, when a client is purchasing a bottle of water from a vending machine, which serves as an IoT terminal in our system (Figure 2). The transaction process begins with both the client and the machine exchanging their public keys which are facilitated as scannable QR codes. Subsequently, using the client’s public key, the machine retrieves their records from the blockchain and verifies his eligibility to complete the purchase process. If the client’s purchase record is full demonstrating negligent recycling behaviour, the transaction will be reverted (Figure 3). Conversely, after verifying the records, both the client and the vending machine employ their private keys to sign the transaction that appends the identifier of the bottle to the client’s purchase record in the blockchain. The signatures of both parties are verified by testing them against the public keys they retrieved from each other in the first Figure 5. Remix IDE output for RecyclingDepot smart contractstage.

This is because the proposed system is likely to have a large number of transactions that need to be processed quickly and efficiently. Hence, a consensus mechanism like Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) elevates as a good fit for this system. DPoS is faster and more scalable than both Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) and is more suitable for ecosystems that require high transaction throughput. Additionally, DPoS is more energy-efficient than Figure 3.

In our system, nodes at levels 1 and 2, along with clients of substantial capacity, super- clients, such as schools, hospitals, and universities, actively participate in the consensus mechanism. Conversely, smaller entities within the system, such as regular users and households, do not engage in the consensus mechanism. The exclusion of smaller entities, such as regular users and households, from the consensus mechanism is a deliberate design choice to ensure scalability and efficiency. By limiting the participation to nodes and clients with substantial capacity, the system can maintain a manageable number of delegates while still benefiting from their expertise and resources.

However, governments, including the South African (SA) government, have failed to recognize the significance of blockchain technology for several reasons, including corruption. The PRISMA methodology was used in this study to conduct a systematic literature review of the use of blockchain technology to improve the integrity and transparency of procurement processes between small-, medium- and micro-enterprises (SMMEs) and the SA government. The Scopus database was used to search for literature, and the final analysis included 12 articles that met the eligibility criteria. The 12 articles were analyzed using thematic analysis and the results demonstrated that 10 of the articles applied to this study as they discussed the use of blockchain in relation to integrity and transparency. The remaining two articles did not emphasize the use of blockchain technology in enhancing the integrity and transparency of the procurement processes. The common factors in the 10 articles that were found to impact integrity and transparency were as follows: handling of contracts, risks involved, security of the data, approaches used, management of the procurement process, transaction processing, the chain of events in the procurement process, access to critical data, the application process for securing contracts, quality of products, costs, and types of contracts. We believe that once blockchain technology has been implemented, SMMEs and the public will trust and be confident in the procurement processes as corruption would have been eliminated and tenders would be awarded fairly.

Introduction growth, job creation, and poverty alleviation [10]. SMMEs have been credited with driving economic growth and development in developed Corruption and a lack of transparency have ravaged some governments countries around the world [11]. Governments frequently engage SMMEs and economies [1]. Corruption is considered one of the most significant to provide services through procurement processes. However, because threats to the economic security of any country or organization [2]. Several of the high levels of corruption within governments, most SMMEs have anti-corruption measures such as legislating, adopting rules and regulations failed to benefit from this trade relationship with governments [12], while making certain behavior illegal, and increasing punishments for illegal some have benefited owing to the corruption [12]. Given the critical conduct [3] have been implemented to reduce or combat corruption. While role that SMMEs and public procurement play in growing a country’s these methods have reduced corruption to a certain extent, perpetrators economy, there is a need to fully support their transactional activities and often find ways to remain corrupt and use various strategies to either escape procurement processes. Thus, several attempts and proposals have been or postpone detection and punishment indefinitely. Therefore, much effort made by researchers and governments regarding methods for eliminating is needed to eradicate corruption. The impact of corruption on developing corruption during procurement processes between governments and economies is devastating because these economies are already struggling private service providers such as SMMEs [3], [13]. Attempts and proposals [4]–[6].

The subsequent section notes and storage mechanisms, a consensus algorithm, smart contracting, presents the methodology followed to conduct a SLR through a literature and asymmetric encryption to ensure network security, transparency, and search to better understand what has currently been done to implement visibility [17].

They incorporate peer-to-peer networks and use distributed consensus algorithms to solve conventional distributed database synchronization problems [19]. Blockchain technology ensures security and transparency through the following processes: 1. The use of digitally distributed databases in which blocks are linked to one another in a linear fashion that cannot be changed. 2. A Merkle tree, which is a data structure that is used to encode blockchain data more efficiently and securely, is saved in the block and is used to validate the transaction. This determines whether a transaction is fraudulent or not. 3. Only when all participants in the supply chain agree on the transaction will a new block of information be added to the blockchain. This ensures that only valid transactions are recorded in the blockchain. 4. When a block is added to the blockchain, it can no longer be tampered with, and the transaction data are permanently recorded. This ensures the preservation of historical records. If a government department adopts blockchain for contract awarding, we anticipate the process to be secure and efficient. For example, a contract will be stored on distributed databases to avoid it being tampered with because once it has been added, it cannot be altered. Blockchain offers the following advantages: reliability, efficiency, fault Figure 1. The PRISMA framework [23]. tolerance, scalability, transparency, and traceability [18], [19], [21].

These programmes, sponsored by enterprises, offer rewards, discounts, and other incentives to attract and retain customers. However, the lack of interoperability among loyalty programmes of different organisations can limit the customer’s ability to maximise the value of their loyalty points. In this study, we proposed the design and implementation of a blockchain-based platform using the design science research (DSR) method as a candidate solution to overcome the limitations of conventional loyalty programmes. Using smart contracts, the design enables organisations to embed all necessary attributes for their desired customer loyalty programmes in accordance with their policies. The designed platform provides a decentralised, transparent, and secure environment for the exchange of loyalty tokens between various organisations and customers. Using expert opinion methodology, we discussed the technical considerations and implementation of the blockchain-based loyalty programme platform, as well as its potential impact on the customer experience. Our findings suggest that the proposed platform can improve the interoperability of loyalty programmes using a universal token that creates more value for businesses and customers. The research contributes to the field of loyalty programmes and blockchain technology by proposing a platform that enable businesses to develop more effective and data-driven loyalty strategies, while providing customers with better value for their loyalty points.

Introduction Blockchain technology is a distributed database comprising encrypted blocks of asset transactions that are sequentially ordered, digitally signed, The advent of diverse computer technologies and networks has resulted and governed by a consensus model [6]. The technology’s potential in in significant and expeditious transformations across all domains. Among addressing these loyalty programme challenges is noteworthy. By embedding the common practices experienced by individuals in their lifetime is the the terms of loyalty programmes in a smart contract, blockchain enables utilisation of loyalty programmes by organisations providing services or organisations to determine the precise reward and profit amounts to be products. Such programmes aim to retain customers within the organisation disbursed to their customers, without the need for trust, in a transparent and enhance their share of wallet [1]. manner. This contract is executed independently and is used to manage the transaction [7]. In recent years, numerous organisations have begun to accumulate customer data to monitor and analyse their behaviour [2]. By studying Providing a suitable blockchain platform for the exchange of these this data, organisations try to design a loyalty programme to keep current privileges between internal and external customers is possible by creating a customers satisfied and attract new customers. token. Tokens are a form of incentive given to customers for participating in a loyalty programme. These tokens are stored on the blockchain and Loyalty programmes include integrated systems of personalised represent specific assets, such as currencies or products. customer marketing and marketing communications, offering tangible (such as discounts or gifts) or intangible (such as personalised service or The blockchain platform offers a secure environment for the exchange information) rewards to the customer [3], [4]. of tokens between various organisations after mutual agreement.

Tokens are not limited to purchases but can various organisations that use disparate methods to provide and manage also encompass the overall customer interaction with the brand or retailer, services, such as physical coupons, digital coupons, or specialised mobile resulting in the integration of digital marketing [8]. applications. The absence of interoperability among loyalty programmes of various organisations leads to a situation where consumers face By providing an integrated and trustless platform, blockchain can control difficulty in effectively utilising the value of their loyalty points, given that the transfer and manage the number of customer assets in any organisation each organisation offers its own system and rewards.

Using the DSR approach and expert opinions, we developed a model with defined conditions which involved collecting user stories and scenarios to identify network usage patterns, followed by writing a smart contract to meet the identified needs and deploying it on the Binance Smart Chain platform. The created artefact was then tested and its efficiency and effectiveness were confirmed through successful transactions. Additionally, we sought the opinions of experts in related fields through an expert opinion approach. Their feedback on the system’s efficacy, potential challenges, and opportunities for commercial implementation was collected and summarised. Our research indicates that blockchain technology offers valuable services that can enhance customer satisfaction, such as token-based point transfers, interoperability, and eliminating the need for paper coupons. The primary objective of such benefits is to capture a larger portion of customers’ wallets, which aligns with the primary goal of loyalty programmes. This research aimed to enhance the productivity of loyalty programmes by leveraging blockchain technology. Based on our research findings, it appears that replacing traditional loyalty systems with blockchain-based platforms is less complicated than previously believed. Complex organisational structures and financial barriers have previously hindered the implementation of this technology. Nevertheless, our proposed platform and smart contract implementation need minimal costs in the case of hardware. Furthermore, increased transparency in wallet transactions may encourage customers to utilise their loyalty points. During the course of our study, we encountered several limitations, including the bureaucratic structures inherent in organisations, which currently impede the widespread adoption of this method.

The nature of DAO Sinclair Davidson FBBA, RMIT University, Australia Category: Oral Presentation Abstract Just as economics Nobel Laureate Ronald Coase famously asked, ‘Why do firms exist?’, this project asks, ‘Why do DAOs exist?’. Blockchain technology overcomes transactional trust issues through decentralisation and the provision of a tamper-proof and transparent ledger. It does not, however, resolve governance trust issues. ‘Who does what, to whose satisfaction?’ remain open and important questions in DAOs just as they do in any and every other organisation. This paper forms part of a project that sets out to establish an intellectually coherent, consistent, and academically robust theoretical framework that locates DAOs within a theory of organisation that can then be used by both practitioners and policy makers. The practical outcomes of this research will include a theory of DAOs; a set of testable hypotheses based on those principles; and a set of recommendations to DAO users and policy makers.

Decentralised Finance (DeFi) in 2034: Impact on Financial Services and Needed Competencies for its Professionals Daniel Liebau, Erasmus University, The Netherlands Category: Oral Presentation Abstract The significance of blockchain-based Decentralized Finance, or DeFi, is rising. In late 2021, crypto-native actors pushed total value locked (TVL), a common measure for the size of this market, above USD 150 billion. The ability to swap digital assets against each other and to give borrowers access to capital without intermediaries, only using smart contracts, were decentralized innovations. Then, these unregulated markets collapsed to ca. USD 40 billion in TVL after the bank run on the Terra LUNA network. But regulators worldwide, including MAS in Singapore, started investigating DeFi primitives and how to use them to resolve some of the critical issues in current Finance. Even the Bank of International Settlements (bis) investigated to understand related risks. It is, therefore, timely to ask what capabilities will be needed by finance professionals and their organizations of any size to remain competitive a decade from now – in 2034. I collect unique survey data amongst participants of my executive education course titled “Decentralized Finance (DeFi): A New Financial Ecosystem” to understand required competencies as they are perceived by experienced financial services professionals in (investment) banks, asset managers, insurers, and regulators.

Token Classification Framework By Consideration Of Origins Of Value And Mechanisms Of Manifestation Thereof Vasily D Sumanov, Simon Polanski, PowerPool, Cyprus Category: Oral Presentation Abstract This paper presents the original Value Capturing Theory (VCT) for digital assets (tokens) study and classification, focusing on the intrinsic value of tokens and acknowledging the significance of demand-side considerations. Traditional classification frameworks overlook these aspects, often assessing tokens based on a wide range of properties without positing a hierarchical structure. In contrast, the VCT introduces a novel framework that classifies tokens based on their value-creating roles in coordinating agent behavior and the primary pathways through which value is realized in the system. In particular, a hierarchical three-level model is developed, wherein a token is attributed several origins of value, and interacting origins of value are grouped by a common pathway they are realized through (termed the Value-Capturing Mechanism). Specific technical implementations of these pathways are recognized. In addition, a method of systematic token design is proposed, and criteria for recognizing novel Value-Capturing Mechanisms are given. Application of the novel framework is demonstrated for both token design for a model system and the decomposition of an extant token according to its origins of value and Value-capturing Mechanisms.

Architectural Design of a Blockchain-Powered Carbon Trading System: A Case Study of the South African Carbon Market Timileyin P Abiodun, University of Johannesburg, South Africa Category: Oral Presentation Abstract To achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to a range of 350 to 420 megatons of carbon dioxide equivalent, South Africa introduced a carbon taxation system in June 2019. However, in just three years, it has become evident that the system faces significant challenges, with less than 6% of the estimated tax returns reaching the government. This issue raises concerns about possible corruption and manipulation within the system. To address these challenges, this study presents a comprehensive framework for a carbon trading and taxation system, leveraging blockchain technology. The unique perspective of designing this framework from the government's perspective ensures efficient monitoring and oversight. Notably, the proposed system operates automatically, eliminating the need for third-party intermediaries. This study also identifies a crucial research gap and lays the foundation for future studies. It plans to empirically implement the system as a decentralised application (dApps) using the Ethereum blockchain network, complemented by ReactJs for the user interface, Node-Red to interface with IoT sensors, and Provable to authenticate and validate data that is being injected into the blockchain network. In summary, this research aims to address the shortcomings of the current carbon taxation system in South Africa through a novel, government-centric approach powered by blockchain technology. The proposed system's potential to enhance transparency and efficiency justifies further exploration in future studies.

Some Simple Institutional Cryptoeconomics of Shared Security Darcy W.E. Allen, Chris Berg, Sinclair Davidson, RMIT Blockchain Innovation Hub, RMIT University, Australia Category: Oral Presentation Abstract Security is an economic good that is costly to produce. Entrepreneurial blockchain communities face a ‘make or buy’ decision to acquire that security. Many complex factors determine whether a project either (1) makes security (e.g. bearing the setup and maintenance costs of a validator set) or (2) buys security from another blockchain or service provider (e.g. a larger blockchain with more economic weight). In recent years several prominent shared security models have emerged including Interchain Security in Cosmos, Eigenlayer in Ethereum, Babylon for Bitcoin and Parachains in Polkadot. These models involve the purchase of security over a blockchain’s organisational boundary, with different contracting structures. In this context, this paper outlines some simple institutional cryptoeconomics of shared security models. We apply institutional economics theory to dissect shared security models, identifying potential contracting hazards that stem from contract incompleteness, asymmetric information and asset specific investments. By applying existing understandings of contract theory to the frontiers of shared security, this paper informs the design of more robust and sustainable shared security models in blockchain ecosystems.

Towards Confidential Chatbots: A Scalable Decentralized Federated Learning Framework Hongxu Su1, Cheng Xiang1 and Bharath Ramesh2 1National University of Singapore - 2Western Sydney University Category: Oral Presentation Abstract The development of cutting-edge large language models like ChatGPT has sparked global interest in the transformative potential of chatbots to automate language tasks. However, alongside the remarkable advancements in natural language processing, concerns about user privacy and data security have become prominent challenges that need immediate attention. In response to these critical concerns, this paper presents a novel approach that addresses the privacy and security issues in chatbot applications. We propose a scalable and privacy-preserving framework for chatbot systems by leveraging the power of decentralized federated learning (DFL) and secure multi-party computation (SMPC). Our DFL framework leverages blockchain smart contracts for participant selection, orchestrating the training process on user data while keeping the data local, and model distribution. After each round of local training by the participants, the blockchain network securely aggregates the model updates using SMPC, ensuring that participants' raw model parameters are not exposed to others. Iterative training rounds are executed through the blockchain network, with participants updating the model collaboratively using SMPC. Experiments show that our approach achieves comparable performance to centralized models while offering significant improvements in privacy and security. This paper presents a novel solution to privacy and security challenges in chatbots and we hope our approach will foster trust and encourage broader adoption of chatbot technology with privacy at the forefront.

Empowering Families in the Genomic Era: A Decentralized Data Trust Approach for Ethical Genomics Management Daniel Uribe, GenoBank.io™, USA Category: Oral Presentation Abstract The field of genomics is at a pivotal juncture, facing challenges in data privacy and the ethical handling of genetic information. Existing genomic data management systems often lack transparency, are inefficient, and do not comply with stringent data protection laws like GDPR or CCPA. Addressing these issues, we propose an innovative AI-governed web3 Genomics Data Family Trust framework, rooted in the principles of DeSci (Decentralized Science). Utilizing the ERC721 standard on EVM-compatible chains, such as the Avalanche C-Chain, our system embeds BioNFTs (Ricardian Contracts) in compliance with local data laws. This approach ensures enhanced transparency and traceability, bolstered by security through client-side encrypted GenoVaults. Additionally, BioWallets enable effective management of genomic assets, with AI oversight ensuring governance standards. A critical aim of this decentralized trust is to foster integration with AI platforms like BioGPT and other advanced GPT and LLMs. This integration supports the acceleration of genomics and clinical data interpretation, consistent with initiatives like FDA 3060 (a) (Clinical Decision Support Software).By embracing DeSci, the platform not only empowers individuals and families with control and secure sharing of their genomic data but also facilitates their participation in groundbreaking genomic research. The adaptability of the system to various genomic data management scenarios underscores its potential to transform genomic research, aligning with the ethos of Decentralized Science to promote open, transparent, and collaborative scientific inquiry.

Assessing the readiness for blockchain technology in the South African public sector Beatah Sibanda, North-West University, South Africa Category: Oral Presentation Abstract The rise in recent technological developments through the Fourth Industrial Revolution has impacted how businesses and governments globally operate, requiring a shift in strategies and governance systems. These technological advances have altered production, management, and governance systems, allowing businesses and governments to respond with agile and complex approaches. A study into one of these technologies reveals that blockchain could enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of operations in the public sector through its transparency-enhancing measures. While governments globally have adopted or are considering blockchain, South Africa still needs to catch up. This study assessed the readiness of the South African public sector to adopt blockchain technology. The population for the study comprised officials in 15 provincial departments in Gauteng province, South Africa. The study adopted a sequential-exploratory approach using the QUAL-QUANT design. If blockchain has the potential to enhance transparency and accountability in the public sector, it is worth assessing if South Africa is ready to accept this technology by obtaining the perceptions of those charged with governance. Although the study's findings suggest that blockchain could be instrumental in improving public sector governance, South Africa may need more time to accept blockchain technology as several deterrents that could hinder adoption were identified, such as resistance to change, change management, and outdated infrastructure. These could, however, be mitigated by skills development and training and the acquisition of the appropriate infrastructure to support blockchain. The study proposes a framework for adopting blockchain technology in the South African public sector to enhance good governance.

Models Of Crypto Projects And Their Properties Oleksandr Letychevskyi, Heriot-Watt University Edinburgh, Scotland Category: Oral Presentation Abstract The research concerns the general abstract model of the crypto project. The algorithmic components of the crypto project, which are defined in the smart contract and their varieties for different services, are highlighted. Typical algorithms for such services as a cryptocurrency exchange, services related to the Internet of Things, education, Internet services and trade are considered. In addition to the algorithmic components, the market component that depends on the external environment, the influence of various external factors, such as the actions of other companies, the statements of celebrities, changes in sales and purchases depending on price changes, is investigated. To predict the scenario of the crypto project, the types of neural networks are considered, which are also included as a component of the crypto project model. Taking into account the algorithmic and market component of the crypto project, the properties of reliability, equilibrium, impossibility of centralization and resistance to malicious actions are investigated. This study is a generalization of the experience of formalization of token economy projects and is an important stage for the creation of a system of analysis and prediction of crypto project scenarios. The presentation will also include demonstrations and comparisons of software systems used in similar analytical studies, including the platform created by the author and his team.
