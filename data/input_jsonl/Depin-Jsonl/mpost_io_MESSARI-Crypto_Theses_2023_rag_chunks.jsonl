{"text": "0.0 WE LCOM E CRYPTO Hello frens! TH ESES It’s been a year. I was masochistic enough to write another annual report. It is my pleasure and pain to present for the sixth year in a row, the Messari Theses for the year ahead. This report started as a tweet thread on New Year’s Day in 2018. Along with the rest of the crypto industry, the Theses has exploded in size and complexity ever since. I write it because it highlights the amazing work the Messari team has done throughout the year, and it helps me update my own mental models for crypto. And I write it for our customers, new and old. Whether you are a crypto novice or a multi-cycle veteran, I hope you can glean some interesting tidbits from this 201-level crypto crash course. As usual, a couple of disclaimers before diving in: 1. This report is free, but nothing herein is investment advice (for all the legal yada yada my lawyers made me include, see the disclaimers section of the Bonus chapter). 2. I stand on the shoulders of giants. I borrow liberally from other authors when they write something more insightful than I can deliver. I link and cite others frequently, but any accidental plagiarism is unintentional and will be corrected promptly. The price of speed is a looser edit, but I work hard to link to primary sources and get this polished. 3. Transparency matters. I have made angel investments in some private projects discussed in this report. Any personal investments in public tokens that are referenced are marked with a star ⭐. My core public holdings have been confined to BTC and ETH this year (and lots of USDC). You’ll notice a couple of important differences between this report and last year’s. For starters, this one is (slightly) shorter.

{"text": "The macro and political backdrops are much different today than they were twelve months ago. I P.S. Here’s a good thread that synopsizes how I feel about crypto today. For your friends that don’t wrapped up the 2022 report when interest rates were near zero, and crypto markets and the S&P sat have the attention span for this book. Or if you prefer a single screenshot: at all-time highs. We didn’t have a single proxy war with a nuclear-armed adversary! And we had Dem- ocratic leadership in both chambers of Congress. 0.1 War Time Portfolios are down 80% since then. Crypto startups are (sometimes) required to have business models before VCs cut checks, and nine figure checks might (maybe) begin to include board oversight. The separation of money and state feels inevitable as countries are getting canceled. Real policy is taking shape in DC, and the outlook for regulatory progress is somewhat rosier. Is this the dark before the dawn, or the beginning of a long Arctic winter? I believe in crypto. Bitcoin and Ethereum seem to be on long-term stable ground. DeFi will take major strides forward next year. Privacy tech will be promoted as an integral part of the future of public blockchains (or get de facto banned on dystopian and vague “national security” grounds). Infrastructure investments around code security, decentralized hardware, virtual worlds, custody, protocol governance, and block- chain scalability are all in vogue. There will be less NFT speculation. Fewer moon fumes. I will probably spend more time in this report deconstructing crypto policy than you would like, but I’ll make fun of important people along the way to keep it zippy. Once again, this beast took me 200 hours to write. That’s a lot, but it’s also down about 20% from last year. I thank the Messari analyst team for those cost savings. They write good stuff daily for Messari Pro subscribers, and you should sign up. If you’re an institution or crypto startup, stop missing key insights: our Enterprise-level offering give your company the research and data tools you need to save more time, energy, and long-term compliance costs on day-to-day crypto work. In 2022, Messari tripled our team size and revenue in a down market. We closed a Series B, launched several new products (Asset Intelligence, Protocol Metrics, Data Apps), and doubled the size of Main- net 2022 in NYC. We’re still hiring. Come with me if you want to live. (This was written in five minutes one summer night in 2021. It remains my North Star.) Every year, people ask me how I write all this stuff in such a short amount of time. Mostly, it’s a labor of love. I am grateful to have the opportunity to build in this industry, and we appreciate the builders who have supported us through thick and thin. This report is a token of appreciation. But if I’m being honest, there’s also a certain amount of rage that fueled this report. The bad actors have gotten all of the oxygen this year, and set back the good actors and years of progress that they had made. I hope The Theses shifts the focus away from the frauds and the tourists, and back to the pioneers. I wrote this in the pioneers’ defense.

Even Bloomberg’s Matt Levine, a crypto skeptic, sees the potential: “Perhaps this is all a self-referential sinkhole for smart finance people, but honestly it would be weird if that’s all it ever turned out to be. If so many smart finance people have moved into the crypto financial system, if they find it so much more enjoyable and func- tional and productive than the traditional financial system, surely they’ll eventually figure out how to make it useful.” The debate doesn’t really center around whether crypto could be good these days. #theses2023 9 #theses2023 10", "metadata": {"source_file": "mpost_io_MESSARI-Crypto_Theses_2023.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/mpost_io_MESSARI-Crypto_Theses_2023.pdf", "page_number": 5, "chunk_id": "mpost_io_MESSARI-Crypto_Theses_2023_p5_c1"}}

Their volumes rival global card networks and banks, and they can actually generate *sustainable* yield now that the true risk-free rate of return (U.S. Treasuries) is above zero.

In many respects, it’s easier to build in bear markets than bull markets. There are fewer distractions, real product-market fit becomes easier to identify without the noise of a token, and the weak and flaky contributors wash out of the market.

ETH currently en- joys a 70%+ market share in what we’ll call the “neutral” L1 space (netting out Binance’s BNB token). In other words, there’s about $155 billion of ETH and $57 billion of “other L1” assets. Whether you think that’s right or not will largely depend on how excited you are by the various other L1 network’s locked market caps and value capture mechanisms. The “venture and insider” ownership of Solana, Avalanche, and Aptos ⭐ tokens, for example, are still quite high. Will selling pressure hit those networks once supply unlocks? Likewise, value capture for other alt-L1 chains, such as Cosmos, remain unclear (though recent efforts have been made to fix that). Will any other L1 developer ecosystem catch up? Will any rival Ethereum’s unit economics as a high value settlement chain? The relative value trades all come down to business development wins (app distribution) and recruiting wins (can you attract developers to build on non-Ethereum blockchains).

In 2015, the answer was bitcoin trading and custody in- frastructure, and dozens of billion dollar companies were formed to provide the on-and-off ramps between the crypto economy and legacy financial system. In 2018, the answer was decentralized applications, and dozens of large DeFi (USDC, Uniswap, Aave), NFT (OpenSea ⭐, Punks, ENS ⭐), and decentralized infrastructure projects (Filecoin ⭐, Helium, The Graph ⭐) were incubated during the depths of winter, while Ethereum and an entire ecosystem of L1 and L2 blockchains emerged to satisfy demand for on-chain blockspace. Look at the biggest problem areas in 2022, and you’ll likely spot the sectors that will spawn the next unicorn solutions. • Want to solve systematic risks? We’ll need investments in disclosures standards (hi, Messari!), proof-of-reserves and on-chain monitoring infrastructure, and crypto’s GAAP accounting moment to discern fundamentals vs. greater fool investing. • Want to solve the hacking problems? This year was a disaster for on-chain hacks, whether it was poor smart contract design, economic model exploits, governance deficiencies, key security issues, social engineering attacks, and more. Solving security issues at scale (with AI monitoring, algorithmic circuit breakers, etc.) will be huge. • Want crypto financial markets to be competitive? Over-collateralized lending isn’t too appealing vs. legacy finance. But you can’t have undercollateralized lending without major default risk…unless you can leverage new identity and reputation primitives. • Want to ensure Amazon or Google or Apple can’t shut down crypto? We still need scalable de- centralized hardware networks, jailbroken device app stores, and decentralized data marketplaces that begin to siphon data from our soon-to-be unstoppable AI overlords. • If you aren’t too creative, but you are entrepreneurial, you can always follow some of the biggest VCs in the space, and ask what they wish existed. A lot of them publish requests for startups, which provide a great starting point to get your creative juices flowing and find areas of interest and potential founder-market fit. How can you not be excited to build? The spoils are there for the taking.

Though contrarian, there are some investors who think it’s more likely that the Fed will pivot once the recession really gets going and accept multi-year high inflation in lieu of a depression or global reserve currency crisis (Watch: Luke Gromen).

Sounds exciting? Well, what if I told you it was possible to take on all of the headache and expense of a startup with none of the upside or limitations of liability? Welcome to DAO governance! It is admirable that various protocol communities have been experimenting with new models of gover- nance, delegation, and financial management. We certainly support that innovation (at least indirectly) through our Governor platform, and we engage frequently with various DAOs during procurement for various projects under our Protocol Reporting segment. But the waters out there are murky and uncharted. Whenever a DAO gets into murky legal waters, voting members would do well to keep in mind their “joint and several” liability under what are legally considered unincorporated associations. Serving as a DAO delegate or voting with your tokens is often a thankless job. And now some reg- ulatory agencies are starting to test the boundaries of their authorities and are more aggressively targeting DAOs as entities subject to potential enforcement actions or other legal liabilities related to problems within their communities. (See the “Ooki DAO” section later on in this report.) If DAOs are going to have a fighting chance at innovating safely, we’ll need better safeguards for their contribu- tors. Quickly.

Bitstamp, Kraken: Regional (European) regulatory risk? I don’t know enough about the various reg- ulatory constructs facing the big EU-dominant exchanges. We’ll cover MiCA in the next chapter on crypto policy, but I’d expect Bitstamp and Kraken to be disproportionate winners (not losers) with better regulatory clarity in Europe. OKX, Huobi, KuCoin, Upbit: Regional (Asian) regulatory risk? Same thing with the largest Asia-based exchanges.

Bitfinex’s close historical affiliation with the stablecoin giant Tether opens the company up to multiple regulatory risks. Bitfinex reached a joint settlement with Tether in 2021 in which the CFTC asserted (among other things) that Tether had “commingled reserve funds with Bit- finex’s operational and customer funds, and held reserves in non-fiat financial products.” Bitfinex and Tether share several core team members, including CTO Paolo Ardoino, and it’s hard to imagine that issues at one entity would be completely isolated from the other.

If there was a big number that changed hands after August 13, I’m not sure how someone new to DCG assesses the risk of a clawback, Grayscale’s large AUM base and its Hotel California structure make it an attractive target for DCG’s which would be a *long-term liability* that hinges on the results of a multi-year, incredibly complex suitors. But it’s DCG’s ownership of underlying GBTC and ETHE that I’m watching most closely in FTX bankruptcy process. February. That’s when Grayscale’s 10-K drops, which includes notes on affiliate ownership of shares in its Trust. 4. The Grayscale-GBTC Tie Up: Some of the details in Fir Tree Capital Management’s lawsuit vs. Grayscale look pretty alarming. They point to the related party levered transactions with 3AC, DCG and Genesis (Grayscale affiliates) spent the better part of the past two years absorbing all of the the repeated tightening of Grayscale’s control over the Trusts’ redemption mechanisms (at the sell pressure from the top GBTC trust shareholders. expense of shareholders), and Grayscale’s ability, but “self-interested” refusal to pursue Reg M re- demptions outside of an ETF conversion. That will take a long time to play out, but the one thing you should have your eye on as a GBTC shareholder is whether DCG’s GBTC shares and Grayscale stay under common control for the foreseeable future. The alternative would not be good. Grayscale throws off $200 million+ in annualized cash flow even at today’s distressed prices. Those assets under management are permanent capital given the trusts’ structure (see below). So the question for a new DCG investor or creditor regarding what Grayscale is worth as a business re- volves around your forward outlook for bitcoin. Grayscale may do $400 million in EBITDA this year, but only half of that on a run rate based on current prices. If DCG explores a sale of Grayscale, they’ll NEED to put the 67 million GBTC shares they own into the deal, too. A buyer without a large GBTC bag would have every incentive to shut down ETF conversion discussions and run the business as an annuity that’s openly hostile to GBTC shareholders. DCG’s $550 million of GBTC acts as an “ETF approval hedge” since they are financially incentivized to push for an ETF. Even though an ETF would open the door for redemptions and lower fees, DCG would notch a one time gain of $450 million from the closure of the GBTC discount to NAV.

I personally think the GBTC 3.6 Custody, Security, Stability is better held as collateral that can be used to help refinance DCG’s current debt load. (See the “ETF Approval Hedge” above.) It comes down to who holds the GBTC. The problems with crypto lending turn out to be pretty obvious: crypto assets are volatile, and many are illiquid, which makes them bad collateral. There are no free lunches when it comes to interest rates The maximum amount that DCG and Genesis would be allowed to sell per quarter in the markets (you pay for returns through higher risks), and there are no lenders of last resort or deposit insurance. (under Rule 144 restrictions) would be 6.9 million shares, or about $80 million if they had sold during the first six weeks of the quarter when GBTC’s discount to net asset value widened from 35% to 45%. For now, there are three things to note about the crypto lending industry moving forward: (It would take the combined companies 2.5 years to unload the full position if that was their ultimate wish, as I explain here.) 1.

Instead, the SEC is taking a victory lap over the carnage that they created after being played for fools and inviting the fox into the henhouse. It’s utterly despicable.

In the meantime, we’re building on the same centralized cloud as everyone else in tech. Technical complexity and economic barriers prevent the average crypto user from solo staking or min- ing; instead, they usually delegate to a professional validator or mining service. Over half of all staked Ether is controlled by three entities: including exchange giants Kraken and Coinbase. Over half of Bitcoin’s hashrate is supplied by three mining pools: Foundry USA, AntPool, and F2Pool.

It was a brilliant and non-intuitive bootstrapping strategy: tag public wallets, analyze them on a best-efforts basis, and leverage Cunningham’s law into iteratively better aggregated data sets (“if our data is wrong, then give us the right data”). That allowed them to hide a robust forensics tool under an NFT flipper’s front end.

Chainalysis was the first crypto data unicorn, and its counterparts Elliptic and TRM Labs don’t appear to be far behind. The primary thrust of these businesses has been transaction monitoring for compliance teams and forensic tools for regulators and investigators. Demand for these tools follows market cap on the way up (more firms need the tools, more fraud gets committed, and more taxes are evaded), and stays somewhat sticky on the way down (investigations take years, compliance needs are permanent, and taxes due from a bull run are still due in full even if your bags get slashed the next year.

Pain. Compliance solutions are fairly sticky, and they’ll sell wherever they are most welcome. It would not surprise me to see some crypto accounting and forensics companies go full Big Brother in the new year, and proactively search for and report suspicious accounts for tax non-compliance. I am in favor of tax compliance, and using every tool at our disposal to catch hackers, rogue states, and criminals who leverage crypto and use it for money laundering or tax fraud. But I am very much against dragnet surveillance and taxpayer harassment. And unfortunately, I think crypto investors will make appealing political scapegoats.

Nothing bad could possibly happen... Litecoin, and Ripple’s XRP. Bitcoin can’t be staked, and recent history has shown why you don’t really want to lend it out to central- ized counterparties. But what if there was a way to generate yield on bitcoin natively without incurring counterparty risk? That’s something Sami wrote up for us earlier this year, and I’m fascinated by the concept, particularly for countries and companies that are otherwise sitting on large stashes of BTC. It all boils down to a bet on the Lightning Network, which I have grown tired of betting on as it has only ever disappointed me. Current lightning capacity is about $90 million. Wrapped Bitcoin on Ethereum (WBTC), which is itself just 10% of the TVL in DeFi applications, is 40x larger. If you had told me this when I started writing ~200 hours ago, I would have done a tweet thread in- stead and called it a day. 5.6 Privacy Coins & Private Transactions Defaults are powerful when it comes to crypto networks. Blockchains like Ethereum are transparent by default and allow for private or “shielded” transactions to be processed in specific pools. But it’s not clear whether that will prove to be a feature or a bug at scale. On the plus side, I’m not sure we would have been able to scale public blockchains under real-world regulatory constraints if they had started off fully private from day one.

Many of these subsequent releases will come faster (and can be tackled The Ethereum Merge was a huge milestone for crypto: a $200 billion network porting over to an en- more iteratively) than the Merge. In a single tweet, Vitalik laid out what’s next: tirely new, scalable transaction ledger with a brand new security model, in real time, with zero hiccups. It was a spectacular technical feat, even if it ended up being boring to watch. That it went off without any major hitches bordered on miraculous, and I will be the first to admit that it was completed much sooner and with less drama than I thought it would be. Vitalik and the Ethere- um Core team deserve major kudos. They aren’t the only ones who have been shipping, though. The alternative Layer-1 ecosystems have been evolving at warp speed. We highlighted Solana’s com- munity traction a couple of chapters ago. Optimistic and ZK-rollup ecosystems have been relentless in onboarding new applications. Cosmos has proven to be a real competitor as it siphoned off more “appchains” to its ecosystem and proposed an overhaul to the economics of its ATOM token. Meta spinout, Aptos, launched its mainnet. If security and scalability is what’s required to accelerate adoption and make room for new killer appli- cations, then the L1 developers killed it this year. That’s not to say L1 development has been all sunshine and rainbows. Upgrades take time and pa- tience, and core developers are scrambling to solve MEV issues, reduce platform downtimes, and ensure their blockchains do not become censorable or damaged by centralization risks. But the future looks bright. *Note: this stuff is highly technical. I’m working on directional correctness and concision, and allowing for some imprecision for the sake of human readability. Let’s walk through this all in plain English: • The Merge: Part one of The Merge forked out Proof-of-Work consensus and switched to Proof-of- Stake (the big milestone this fall – Why Proof-of-Stake).

This tax, MEV, exists on every blockchain, so it can be thought of as a feature, not a bug, in some ways. MEV can arguably make protocols more liquid, efficient, and antifragile. A healthy MEV sub-economy would redistribute most MEV rewards to staking tokenholders, and ensure that the transaction pro- cessing “supply chain” separates block proposers (anyone) and block builders (specialists) in a global, decentralized block building competition. In fact, censorship is the primary post-Merge concern with Ethereum right now. When the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Tornado Cash, many post-Merge validators (who had become more recognizable and sophisticated in a MEV-rich post-Merge environment) began to censor certain addresses and transaction types. Large custodians, exchanges, cloud staking services (like Alchemy), and even decentralized RPC relayers (like Pokt) became OFAC-compliant, basically A block proposer is the same thing as a transaction validator.

Let’s drill down the different types of rollups and the “modular blockchain” thesis, then talk about today’s two largest non-EVM ecosystems, Solana and Cosmos. 6.6 Rollups and Modularity Rollups improve blockchain scalability by executing transactions on separate blockchains, then post- ing compressed transaction data to an underlying L1. Traditional rollups that rely on Ethereum L1 for settlement, consensus, and data availability were first to market with Arbitrum and Optimism Layer-2s launching in 2021. The new kid on the block, Celestia, ushered in the “modular” thesis which became all the rage this year. While traditional rollups execute transactions and rely on Ethereum to settle, verify, and store their data, modularity allows developers to mix and match how their protocols handle each step. We’ll touch on modularity a bit more below, but first let’s dig into the rollups to watch this coming year. As an individual user, you don’t really care if the button you push on a front-end service is routing your crypto transaction over a bridge to an EVM compatible “alt-L1” like Avalanche or an “appchain” built on Cosmos, or whether it’s processed on a rollup chain like Arbitrum. What you do care about is that your assets are secure when in transit, and that they are there on-chain when you want them back. High net worth investors, corporates, and governments certainly care about security. If a rollup suffers an outage or vulnerability you can always claim funds on its associated parent L1. If a Layer-1 block- chain has an outage or significant performance issue, you’re out of luck until things are back up and running. When everything is working, there’s no difference between rollups, appchains, and alt-L1s. But the security issues can get ya. Bad. It’s all pretty similar to the global banking system, actually: you don’t really care how your neighbor- Smart Contract Rollups: A smart contract on L1 verifies batches of compressed transactions using hood bank routes your payment through the banking network.

Solana has had a tough go in the wake of the FTX bankruptcy. After a red hot 2021, Solana has come back down to earth.

It’s unclear whether ATOM 2.0 will work (it has received pushback on its ambition as a proposal for its adoption was rejected by the community), but while that developer debate plays out, Cosmos will likely remain the top ecosystem for “sovereign” appchain developers. The flexibility Cosmos affords developers in creating their own chains (custom inflation schedules, transaction fees, transaction types, security models, coding languages, etc.) and the value accrual mechanisms the IBC affords appchains (MEV, transaction costs, etc.) make the ecosystem compelling for those with the technical chops to vertically integrate their apps. Look no further than dYdX, argu- ably the largest application in crypto, which migrated from a ZK-rollup to an appchain this year. While L2s may inherit the $100 billion security budget of Ethereum at virtually no cost (periodic call data and no need to support a dedicated validator set), the tie-up with the EVM affords less flexi- bility, more interoperability challenges, lower throughput, and higher direct costs. When one of the most successful, high-throughput dApp developers switches backends, others will likely listen. Unless L2 speeds increase significantly or more non-financial transactions are pushed off-chain (DeSoc likes, gasless Snapshot voting, etc.), the apps people use could end up on Cosmos. The new standard op- erating model for successful decentralized applications could be to leverage an L1 as an initial launch- pad: build, scale, and then migrate to a custom appchain. 6.9 Other L1s I don’t want to gloss over some of the other L1 chains I wrote about last year. Instead I’ll consolidate them here. Some are dead. Others live on. But I only have so many hours to write about these things, and there are still several chapters ahead. Cardano had a big year of technical upgrades, including Plutus smart contract capabilities and the Vasil hard fork with upgrades to Plutus and better scaling.

It’s time for security and audit standards. Risk waivers. Comprehensive communi- ty disclosures. And apps that work beyond speculative teaser rates.

On the other hand, undercollateralized lenders like Goldfinch ⭐ and Maple Finance offer yield on undercollateralized positions and have been able to generate You would think these protocols would be upside down now that crypto risk premia are rising and double-digit yields from this riskier form of lending. real-world yield is a bit easier to come by.

Lending to delta-neutral crypto market makers worked well to avoid the fallout from Terra. Maple’s delegates may have been more prudent with counterparties, even through the fall. But crypto delivers risk in unexpected ways. Contagion from FTX led Maple to liquidate loans worth $37 million, reducing its active loans to just $41 million. Of that, $10 million is now distressed. Goldfinch still has a pristine track record, in part because it lends to non-crypto borrowers only (less reflexivity). But the protocol does have its own unique risks, such as higher exposure to developing economies and the fintech sector. As rates have risen, Aave decided to get in on the overcollateralized stablecoin game as well. Its GHO stablecoin, native to the Aave protocol, will allow protocol “facilitators” to mint a limited amount of GHO in a trustless manner and allow users to borrow GHO while earning yield on deposited collater- al.

{"text": "7.5 Superfluid Collateral & Synthetic Stakes Liquid staking protocols made it more palatable for thousands of Ethereum investors to stake ETH and help bootstrap the security of Ethereum’s post-Merge Proof-of-Stake blockchain. A game for whales (a 32 ETH minimum is required to stake), with significant duration and technical risk (you didn’t know when your staked ETH would become available again in the leadup to The Merge, which had been fraught with technical risks and years-long delays), and high opportunity cost (you can’t use your ETH in the NFT or DeFi markets), was opened to all thanks to protocols like Lido and Rocket Pool. These staking protocols were able to catalyze thousands of incremental ETH stakers thanks to the creation of new synthetic assets, staked ETH (Lido’s stETH and Rocket Pool’s rETH) that accrued Ethe- reum’s staking rewards (for a 10% fee) atomically, and were liquid and tradable as soon as they were minted. Maple Finance had a strong track record, as did Genesis Capital and BlockFi. But in a full risk-off environment with poor on-chain identity, reputation, and creditor infrastructure, this market has gone ice cold. Goldfinch is down 90%+ since its public launch at the beginning of the year. Maple is down 90%+ since its April high. It’s doubtful that crypto will ever compete with legacy banks at scale without undercollateralized lend- ing. The question is whether we have the right building blocks (credit scores, insurance, and yes, credit default swaps) that make this sector of DeFi viable in the short term. Can we use smart contracts, on- chain data, soulbound NFTs, and DeSoc identities to replace loan officers? I hope so, but it feels like it may simply be too early. (Required Reading: Maple Finance: Sweet and Steady, Goldfinch Finance: Let’s Get Real) Post-Merge, the economics of staking are even more compelling. With ETH inflation falling to near zero and validators earning real revenue (tips and MEV) on each pro- cessed block, the “real returns” to stakers have spiked to 6%. Further, when withdrawals go live on the Ethereum staking contract as part of the Shanghai upgrade planned for sometime in 2023, the risk of staking ETH (and synthetic instruments) will fall considerably as the minimum duration for staking will fall to just 27 hours. There will be little to no reason to avoid staking ETH, and the result could be a boon for Lido and Rocket Pool, and to attract participation from more centralized players. We expect DAOs, exchanges, and other institutional ETH holders to stake en masse post EIP-4895. DAOs have a combined $11 billion in treasury assets. Coinbase has even more under custody.

Whenever I hear someone pitch crypto gaming as a key sector to watch, this is how I feel. Instead of games extracting value from players via Downloadable Content (DLC) and micro-transac- tions, game creators can make money as marketplace operators (transaction fees). Users are incentiv- ized to buy or earn top game items (the Play-to-Earn (“P2E”) model popularized by Axie Infinity). There’s three problems, though. 1. To build a sustainable P2E gaming franchise, the game needs to be, ya know, fun. Was Axie fun? Or was it a flash in the pan, bubble, or success story on par with the 2,000% APY DeFi pools that spiked for a moment, then tanked? My hunch is that more people were treating Axie as an odd job last year and not a pastime. 2. To make a fun game, you generally need a lot of money. Development timelines are long, and final products are expensive. Game development is significantly longer than software due to the art components and additional complexities. The higher the quality of the game, the longer the time- line. When NFT game items and complex token mechanisms are also thrown into the mix, game development might be even longer and harder to change compared to other areas of crypto software. Don’t worry.

Great graphic on the gaming sector pp 31-40, too.) 8.5 The Cryptoverse Using an Oculus for the first time and building that blue virtual mesh cage around myself was one of the coolest tech experiences I’ve ever had. I also haven’t used the Oculus in over a year. Maybe it’s lockdown fatigue, and I just prefer to see people in person when I can. When I can’t, Zoom is still better than floating metaverse avatars. It still feels like we’re years away from hardware that makes the cryptoverse not suck. The exception might be for gamers (I’m not one), teledildonics (no judgment, but again, not my jam), and gambling (if you’re in crypto, who needs blackjack?). We’ll continue to cover the crypto metaverse, but I’m only likely to buy land in the metaverse if a distressed Decentraland plot comes on to the market. Otherwise, one of the only apps I’ve been in- (Source: Token Terminal) trigued by is Decentral Games, a DAO with crypto metaverse poker rooms with a real business model that does $2 million / year in fees. You literally cannot see fees since the spring using this y-axis because they are down to less than $1 million / year on an annualized basis. Though with less disposable income, cryptoverse players aren’t biting as often...that $2 million fee figure is down from a $36 million pace in Q1. Ouch. If you think token trading, gambling, and financial negotiations are interesting, there are ways to express that passion productively in society. Namely in finance (legacy or crypto). I’m not sure adding tokens, financial alchemy, and creating steep player buy-in costs is a good way to build a fun game, or at least not one with a very large community. I fully understand and appreciate that the gaming market is enormous at nearly $200 billion per year, and I fully expect some teams to knock it out of the park with a crypto game at some point. It might even be one of the sparks for a “cross-the-chasm” moment for crypto or AR/VR. But it’s the most overhyped sector of crypto right now. Last year I said, “The play-to-earn gaming trend is here to stay. The amount of money these plat- forms have raised is nuts, and they’re set up for a full cycle of iteration and development regardless of whether the sector’s frenzy subsides next year.” Though I did expect a pretty rapid cooling of Axie’s growth, I thought some of the big checks going into crypto games last year were based on some substantive development efforts. If they were, I ha- ven’t seen them. It’s just as likely that they were part of the foie gras-ing of the broader crypto entre- preneurial class. I remain bullish on our AR/VR future, but I’m not about to bet the farm on it happening any time soon. The people who have done that have gotten their faces blown off this year.I’m bearish, and will only update my thesis when I see some signs of life or startup valuations that don’t pull forward ten years of credit for the entrepreneurs building in this sector. It sort of reminds me of early social networks. I’ll invest as much as possible in the first actually fun franchise at a high- er valuation and pay for the derisked assets then.

Front ends like Lenster resemble traditional social media apps, but they read and write data to the social graph layer (Lens, Farcaster) and the content storage layer (IPFS, Arweave) instead of their That’s because a) I think it’s easier to build DeSoc communications networks iteratively (this has been own app. The core piece of DeSoc, though, is the social graph layer. true historically when you look at social media vs. game studios’ capital expenditures), and b) more of the value in gaming lies in the front-ends (best built by centralized visionaries) vs. the back-end (easier to decentralize via open-source software). The Web2 social industry happens to be nearly identical in size to the gaming space, $220 billion in annual ad revenue alone.

Likewise, OpenSea made the decision .eth, .crypto, .lens, and a handful of others as the most popular identifiers, much like we have .com, to enforce on-chain NFT royalties, reaping $1 billion in exploitative gains for…its creators? .org, and .io as the most popular domains today. I’ve been a casual observer over the furor that’s risen up over OpenSea’s royalty change last month. But, to be honest, it didn’t really register for me given the broader market backdrop and my interpre- tation of (much of) the anger as coordinated outrage amongst competitors that haven’t quite been able to nip at OpenSea’s heels the way they wanted to. (More on that next section.) I will grant you that royalty enforcement sucks at the user level. If you’re wrecked on an NFT “invest- ment,” you want to recoup as much as you possibly can. If you are looking to scoop up new NFTs on the cheap, you want your marketplace aggregators to have a full selection of assets, and you’ll will be pissed off if royalty enforcement reduces your access to certain collections or breaks your filters. But I happen to think the right default in the long-term is to side with the creators. If creators want to opt out of royalties given the current market conditions as a way to help their fans get through the bear market, that makes sense. But I also think it’s a sign of how baby sh*t soft some NFT punters are. You buy a picture of a second-tier cartoon PFP that had embedded royalties baked into all transfers at the mint, a work of digital art that just “really spoke to you,” and now that the market has turned, what, f*ck the artists?

We need better reliability and standardization around on-chain data, and better access to secure, verified “real-world” data in order for crypto (par- ticularly DeFi) to reach its full potential. With respect to on-chain data, The Graph is the dominant decentralized data infrastructure project today. Data consumers typically use APIs to pull blockchain data that is otherwise not easily accessible With respect to off-chain data sources (whether we’re talking about crypto asset prices or any otheror well-structured.

It won’t happen overnight, but I still believe DAOs will change countless aspects of the economy, poli- tics, and society at large in the years ahead. Blockchains give us the ability to run centralized marketplaces on autopilot, giving their peripheral contributors more financial upside, autonomy, and governing control. The lenders and borrowers in a crypto lending protocol govern the “code bank’s” risk parameters and fees - and earn them. The driv- ers and riders in a crypto ridesharing protocol govern pricing tiers and safety standards. The patients in a rare disease community can raise funds for their own treatment research, then recoup the upside if a drug is successfully commercialized.

It specializes in helping patients with rare diseases find new treatments and connect with others like them. In crypto, there’s Vibe Bio, which aims to actually change the incentive structures in biotech. The protocol makes it easier for patients and families affected by rare diseases to fund (and profit from) the drug funding and research process. • Small SPACs: ConstitutionDAO was the equivalent of a flash mob, a toy that showed how easily single purpose communities could rally around a given cause and fund an investment. In this case, it was the Constitution of the United States. But could this concept extend the “SPAC” model to rescue a sports club? Or buy out a small business or crypto venture? What about funding litigation versus a deep-pocketed enemy? The toy works.

It seems like a stretch, but this concept of “joint and sever- al” liability for DAOs (deemed unincorporated associations) would have a big chilling effect on DAO #theses2023 157 innovation and participation if it were to stand. Indeed, that’s what’s led many to cry foul in this particular case. Holding a 1% tokenholder individually liable for CFTC violations doesn’t seem to be a good use of the agency’s mandate, and it would turn into a logistical nightmare. Instead, if you’re the CFTC, you could use this as an opportunity to set legal precedent and win an easy case by default (regulation via enforcement).

As I said in the introduction, this is a good marketing asset for attracting enterprise customers, partners, and recruits; it should drive good conversion to our Pro product (ahem), and it doubles as my annual crypto deep dive andB O N US: YO D RE , I G OT SO M E T H IN ’ TO SAY product ideation session. “What did I miss, and where are we headed?” I’d flip the question back to you: how can you survive the remote-first, globally-distributed, hy- per-growth, crypto chaos without writing well? Reading helps me identify blind spots, but it’s writing 10.0 Intro 166 that helps me focus and streamline my thoughts. 10.1 Why You Must Write 166 Whether it’s code or prose, you must get better at writing. And when you write, be concise and write 10.2 No Idols 166 music. Last year, I wrote: “good code elegantly communicates your ideas to computers, and spits out products that delight users.

If you want a case study in the perils of a high profile, just look at the number of “crypto billionaires” who are now on the lam, penniless, or in prison after overextending themselves and believing too many of their own press clippings. Stay hungry and humble. Stay disciplined. Stay hard. Merry Christmas. 10.3 Must Read High Output Management, Shoe Dog, Principles, Crypto, The Federalist Papers. Learn the Cadence of a SaaS startup, lessons from vertical software investing, and how to work backwards. Subscribe to Bankless, the top crypto pod. Turn off Twitter notifications. “Don’t follow your passion. Seriously. Don’t follow your passion. Your passion is likely more dumb and useless than anything else. Your passion should be your hobby, not your work. Do it in your spare time. Instead, at work, seek to contribute. Find the hottest, most vibrant part of the economy you can and figure out how you can contribute best and most. Make yourself of value to the people around you, to your customers and coworkers, and try to increase that value every day.” #theses2023 165 #theses2023 166", "metadata": {"source_file": "mpost_io_MESSARI-Crypto_Theses_2023.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/mpost_io_MESSARI-Crypto_Theses_2023.pdf", "page_number": 83, "chunk_id": "mpost_io_MESSARI-Crypto_Theses_2023_p83_c1"}}

Mind, Body, Soul: I have had Headspace installed on my home screen for five years and have used it ~12 times. (Once since last year!) I have also learned that I get a really good night’s sleep when I read books before bed and turn off my phone without ending my day doomscrolling Twitter. I have even done this successfully three or four times, and I have completed the first chapter or two of dozens of books. I have gotten so out of shape sprinting to finish this report, so I’m going to go hit things now (Thanks, Fightcamp). 10.5 Life Advice I’ll end the same way I did last year: I don’t know what I’m doing and neither do you. But if you are fortunate enough to do so: get married, have kids, and move to the burbs. (Eventually). You will survive the winters and gain some valuable perspective when your day ends with a six-year- old laughing about one of his farts, a four-year-old telling you a story via a three minute run on sen- tence and a half-naked two-year-old tackling you at the knees during your final Zoom call of the day. If you’re reading this, you are (hopefully) a time billionaire. That does not change the fact that you are at The Tail End of many of your relationships (I read this post once per year), and that it is always Day 1 and everything is in your control. 2022 is in the books.
