However, this transition will take time as the region evolves and integrates more advanced financial solutions. Looking at the same data through an alternative lens, it becomes apparent that the region is dominated by consumer solutions, followed by enterprise and specialized solutions. Traditional finance has struggled to serve Latin American consumers due to high operational costs, limited physical infrastructure, and stringent requirements that exclude large segments of the population from accessing financial services.

{"text": "Mechanism Of Transmission Stablecoins have played a critical role in the adoption of any DeFi/OpenFi solutions so far. The ability to have fiat-denominated assets represented on the blockchain is critical for tying in blockchain technology into the real economy. Today stablecoins are the mechanism of transmission, serving as the base denominator for blockchain- based transactions such as trading, remittances, saving products and more. Without stablecoins, the decentralized financial ecosystem would be nowhere near as big as it is today. Overall, we believe that Fintech breaks down into four different Web3 trends as discussed below. OpenFi Open Finance (OpenFi) aims to combine the functionality of the traditional financial system with the permissionless, modular, and ownership-centric benefits of decentralized finance. OpenFi increases access to the financial system, improves liquidity, and makes it more efficient from a cost and innovation perspective. DeFi Decentralized Finance (DeFi) focuses on providing the infrastructure for a decentralized financial system through blockchain technology, oracles, and core DeFi protocols. DeFi aims to create an open, permissionless, transparent financial ecosystem without intermediaries. By leveraging blockchain infrastructure and oracles, DeFi enhances financial data and transactions' security, accuracy, and reliability. This approach democratizes access to financial services and fosters innovation, reduces costs, and improves overall efficiency within the financial sector. 11 Strictly private & confidential, © Outlier Ventures Operations Ltd.

{"text": "RWA Tokenization Tokenization is the process through which a digital twin of a real-world asset is created and populated on the blockchain in the form of a digital token or NFT. The process of tokenization populates the blockchain (which is a database) with “digital copies” of RWAs. Tokenization is an important step to unlocking financial services on blockchain as it allows the representation of non-crypto-native assets, such as financial instruments on this new database. Privacy & Identity Privacy and identity involve privacy-enhancing technology like zero-knowledge proofs, homomorphic encryption, and multiparty computation. These computational approaches aim to protect user identities and transaction details, ensuring anonymity and data security when needed. P&I plays an important role in fintech because it builds trust, prevents fraud, and ensures compliance. It’s a critical but often overlooked element in the journey to move fintech solutions completely on-chain. WHY NOW? Finally, we answer why we think it’s a good time to be active in Web3 x Fintech in the LatAM region. • Mechanism Of Exchange - Stablecoins, which serve as the mechanism of exchange of Web3 financial dApps are seeing broad adoption and regulatory approval. • Scaling - Scaling is coming online, lowering transaction costs and making low-value exchange use cases like payments economically viable. • Smart Wallets - Wallets are experiencing a renaissance with the embedding of AI, abstraction of accounts, and more. We also recently saw the EIP-7702 being discussed. • Cross-border Transactions - The region has a high demand for efficient and cost- effective cross-border payment solutions, which DeF/OpenFi can facilitate. • Neobanks - Neobanks are moving towards semi-custodial solutions and crypto rails.

Web3 continues to evolve, it emphasizes player empowerment, economic inclusivity,In doing so, it grants players true and innovative gameplay experiences,ownership of in-game assets, ensures ultimately reshaping the gaming landscapesecure data storage, and maintains game in the LatAM region. THE WEB3 ANGLE Overall, we believe that gaming breaks down into three different Web3 trends as discussed below. Blockchain-Based Gaming In the context of Web3, gaming refers to games (partially) hosted on blockchain infrastructure, focusing on ownership of in-game assets, interoperability between gaming instances, and decentralized governance and maintenance of the IP and infrastructure. Compared to traditional gaming (Web2), Web3 gaming not only aims to return control over many aspects of gaming to the players but also seeks to enhance gaming experiences by leveraging unique elements of blockchain infrastructure in game design. 22 Strictly private & confidential, © Outlier Ventures Operations Ltd.

{"text": "Privacy & Identity We previously defined Privacy & Identity. P&I are not only important for the users, they are equally important for good game design. Many games, including strategy, MMOs, MOBAs, etc., are based on information asymmetry, commonly referred to as “the fog of war”. The lack of information between players requires players to strategize. Blockchain technology is naturally transparent, theoretically allowing anyone to see the state of the information on the blockchain and as a result the state of the game. So something is needed to allow better information asymmetry for fully onchain games (FOCG). Privacy-enhancing technology (PET) like ZK, FHE and MPC does exactly this and is a critical piece to allow all aspects of gaming to move onchain. Social We previously defined Social. Decentralized social in gaming strengthens community and trust among players, allowing them to carry over achievements, assets, and progression across different gaming instances and environments. RWA We previously defined RWA. RWA tokenization in gaming allows players to securely use and trade tangible and intangible assets within the game environments, blurring down the barriers between the physical and virtual realms. Technically, every game asset put on the blockchain is done through the process of tokenization. WHY NOW? Finally, we answer why we think it’s a good time to be active in Web3 x Gaming in the LatAM region. • Infrastructure - Infrastructure is a significant bottleneck for fully on-chain games. The rise of L2 and L3 solutions with gaming SDKs and a multichain approach highlights efforts to overcome these limitations. • Porting Over - Web2 gaming studios and incubators partner with tooling providers to transition to Web3 infrastructure. • Integrating Features - Many Web3 games are now positioning themselves as Web2 with new features, a successful strategy for attracting new users. 23 Strictly private & confidential, © Outlier Ventures Operations Ltd.

{"text": "THE WEB3 ANGLE In the context of the structural trends in LatAM we’ve identified so far, we believe there are five interesting pockets of Web3 infrastructure which look promising for anyone trying to catch these tailwinds. Decentralized Finance We previously defined DeFi. The importance of mature DeFi systems within Web3 cannot be overstated. Web3 leads to the hyper-financialization of many aspects of the economy through trends such as RWA tokenization and the use of utility tokens. As a result, a sound, decentralized financial infrastructure layer made up of blockchains, core DeFi primitives, and oracles is needed to create liquid, peer-to-peer markets around these assets and disintermediate as many parties as possible in the process to achieve the most efficient, secure, and transparent system possible. DePIN Decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) refer to networks that leverage blockchain to provide infrastructure to support operations, distribution, and management of economically important resources and services. Many traditionally centralized business models, such as telecommunications, digital services, IoT, and others, are being challenged by decentralized networks that offer competing and complementary services. We also have recent examples of how centralization of economically important soft- and hardware leads can lead to key entity risk (for ex. Crowdstrike outage). AI x Crypto AI and blockchain technology have a natural, strong fit driven by their relationship with data. AI is about extracting value from data, while blockchain technology is about storing data in new ways. The combination, or convergence, of both technologies involves integrating previously siloed technology stacks into one. In doing so, we hope to unlock new use cases such as decentralized compute, agentic systems, decentralized model training, and more. For these use cases to materialize, infrastructure needs to be built that is geared toward hosting both technologies on the same tech stack. 26 Strictly private & confidential, © Outlier Ventures Operations Ltd.

{"text": "Blockchain-Based Gaming We previously defined blockchain-based gaming. Gaming on the blockchain is widely seen as the next major growth phase for the industry, but there are still infrastructure limitations (and by extension investment opportunities). Playing games requires numerous actions (movement, skills, buffs, etc.) by gamers, constantly changing the game state. To move all this activity on-chain, we need a drastic increase in infrastructure throughput. Additionally, (smart) wallets are needed to host in-game assets, privacy solutions to create a \"fog of war,\" and much more before we can fully transition on-chain. RWA Tokenization We previously defined RWA Tokenization. Sitting on top of the DeFi infrastructure, RWA middleware, SDK and special purpose infrastructure are a critical component to unlock the true value of blockchain databases and smart contracts by bringing RWAs into the realm of distributed ledger technology. Having rule-based automated execution of any form of transaction tied to real world tangible and intangible assets on a transparent database has applications in many different pockets of society. The endgame here is to unlock the “computational economy”. We discussed this in detail in our previous work. 27 Strictly private & confidential, © Outlier Ventures Operations Ltd.
