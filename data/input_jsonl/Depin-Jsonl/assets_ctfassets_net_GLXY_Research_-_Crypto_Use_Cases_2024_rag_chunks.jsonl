{"text": "3 GALAXY RESEARCH CRYPTO USE CASES Introduction In recent years, businesses and organizations have devoted time and resources to adapting their traditional business models to incorporate cryptocurrency (“crypto”) and other disruptive technologies like AI, cloud computing and big data. Crypto offers benefits such as speed, resilience, transparency, cost efficiency and accessibility. While there are critics who remain skeptical, most people understand that crypto has utility beyond speculation. The overarching mission of crypto is to foster a more equitable and inclusive digital economy built upon decentralized, trust- minimized blockchain infrastructure. Unlocking new capabilities and streamlining information sharing in an individual-centric approach, crypto is a fundamentally new tech paradigm that transforms the ways in which we create and share value. However, a valid criticism is that the industry’s proponents often conflate the end state with the current state of adoption by making forward promises about crypto’s utility. Crypto is facing the cold start problem – the underlying technology is still in the early development stages and its adoption faces significant barriers including customer education, trust gaps, and regulatory uncertainty, along with UX challenges to interacting with decentralized applications. Widespread adoption requires products and services must be intuitive and accessible. However, improvements to performance, scalability and reliability are constantly being made to the infrastructure layer to make it even easier to launch and scale new useful products, which then can create network effects that add to the value of crypto platforms. While the crypto industry has a long way to go achieve its overarching vision, it has already achieved product-market-fit (PMF) in several use cases across various verticals.", "metadata": {"source_file": "assets_ctfassets_net_GLXY_Research_-_Crypto_Use_Cases_2024.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/assets_ctfassets_net_GLXY_Research_-_Crypto_Use_Cases_2024.pdf", "page_number": 3, "chunk_id": "assets_ctfassets_net_GLXY_Research_-_Crypto_Use_Cases_2024_p3_c1", "title": "2024 Crypto Use Cases", "author": "Galaxy Research", "creationDate": "D:20240508124947-04'00'"}}

Significant industry progress has been made in speed, scale and network resiliency in just the last year alone. Ongoing technical research areas are focused on privacy (i.e., separating sensitive information from transparent, public blockchains), composability and interoperability – all of which should unlock new app utility and enhance the potential of the crypto economy. Certain use cases with obvious beneficial value propositions have not been included in this presentation due to limited adoption or effectiveness so far. These include applications in governance, supply chain management, healthcare, and ticketing/events, which must address regulatory clarity or social coordination challenges to become effective crypto use cases. However, many of these headwinds to adoption are expected to ease with greater buy-in of crypto technology by individuals and businesses for other stated use cases. In addition, the value of decentralization should become clearer as centralized service providers inevitably face disruptions over time.
