Large-cap tokens like Bitcoin ETF Approval and Ether outperformed expectations, closing significantly higher than their early Spot ETHSeptember lows, marking a surprising rebound during a seasonally challenging period. ETF Launch In November, political developments added further momentum to digital assets. Following Trump’s election victory, expectations of pro-cryptocurrency regulatory changes bolstered market sentiment. These political tailwinds, combined with increased government spending expectations, led to the highest fund inflows since February’s spot Bitcoin ETF launch, totaling $5.4 billion. The launch of options on Bitcoin ETFs was met with enthusiasm, further fueling Bitcoin’s rally to new all-time highs. This surge also triggered a catch-up trade in the altcoin market, allowing it to capitalize on Bitcoin’s upward momentum. US Election The month of December opened with strong momentum in digital asset markets, as Bitcoin surged to $108,000 ahead of the Federal Reserve’s December meeting. However, this optimism was tempered on December 18th, when the Fed announced a 25-basis-point interest rate reduction alongside unexpectedly hawkish guidance, signaling only two additional rate cuts in the near term. This shift in tone prompted a sharp retreat across the digital asset market, with Bitcoin declining 15% from its peak and the altcoins erasing most of the gains they accrued since the post-election breakout in November.

{"text": "Measuring the Macro Growth Outlook Sentiment Surges After 2016 and 2024 Wins The global economy maintains moderate growth heading into 2025, marked by stark regional disparities. While U.S. markets digest election results and anticipated Federal Reserve policy shifts, mounting 2016 Election pressures from China's property sector crisis, political turbulence in Europe, and persistent inflation in 2024 Election developing economies heighten global uncertainty. Can Animal Spirits Awaken Economic Dynamism? The U.S. economy is set to begin the new year with measured optimism following Donald Trump's return to the presidency. While markets and businesses respond favorably to expectations of deregulation and potential tax cut extensions, questions linger about the sustainability of this sentiment and the true drivers of growth. The economy is projected to maintain a modest growth rate through mid-2025—a pace that aligns with potential but falls short of exceptional. This expansion rests primarily on two pillars: sustained consumer spending and recovering business investment. Affluent households, whose spending patterns closely track market performance, remain critical to maintaining aggregate demand as equity markets show renewed strength. Keynes' famous \"animal spirits\" are alive and kicking, as the small business sector exhibits renewed U.S. GDP Contributions & Consenus Forecasts confidence post-election. Companies are positioning themselves for future opportunities despite ongoing uncertainties around trade policy and broader economic conditions. However, the potential persistence of restrictive monetary policy may pose a significant challenge to this optimistic outlook. So, where does that leave us? 2025's economic narrative balances optimism with prudence. While revived business confidence may fuel certain sectors, overall growth likely remains anchored near its longer-term potential. The interplay between Federal Reserve policy, consumer behavior, and business investment will shape the year's economic trajectory, suggesting investors should maintain modest growth expectations while seeking secular opportunities in disruptive technology.

While global inflation is on track to cool, the road ahead remains uneven. Progress, Patience, and Persistent Risks In the United States, inflation is likely to linger above the Fed’s 2% target, with the consensus projection for Core PCE at 2.3%. Price pressures are cooling, but sticky services inflation and wage-driven costs continue to smolder. Shelter and core services remain persistent culprits, while an equity-driven wealth effect could keep demand surprisingly buoyant. It’s a victory of sorts—consider where we were two years ago—but not one that leaves policymakers or markets entirely at ease, particularly as cyclical factors continue to influence price pressures. A Mixed Picture... Across the Atlantic, Europe’s inflation outlook is more encouraging. Headline inflation is set to fall to 2% by mid-2025, driven largely by energy base effects and moderating wage growth. The ECB is likely to respond with a steady string of rate cuts—100 basis points over the year—bringing borrowing costs closer to neutral. Still, political uncertainty in major economies like France and Germany looms large, leaving room The Global Inflation Picture for unexpected economic disruptions. Japan’s inflation story is no longer just about temporary cost-push factors like energy or imported goods. The foundation is shifting. Wage growth—Japan’s Achilles’ heel for decades—is finally picking up. Furthermore, persistent currency weakness pushing up the cost of imports, and inflation has staying power. For emerging markets, inflation is a tale of contrasts. China, grappling with deflationary pressures amid a protracted property slump, remains an outlier. Meanwhile, Turkey and Argentina are cooling runaway inflation but still battling rates well outside the comfort zone. India, on the other hand, balances a tight RBI policy with structural growth drivers, keeping inflation steady as the economy accelerates.

The Federal Reserve remains the center of attention, and is poised to trim rates Fed Adopts a More Hawkish Glide Path cautiously while keeping its hawkish toolkit close. Elsewhere, the ECB, BOE, and a mix of emerging market players are on their own distinct trajectories—some loosening policy aggressively, others holding the line. Measured Cuts, But No Victory Lap The Federal Reserve, after its December 25-basis-point rate cut, signaled what many market participants already anticipated: easing is coming, but at a more gradual pace. By year-end, we now expect only 75 basis points of cumulative cuts - a more cautious path than pre-election forecasts suggested, but 25 basis points more than the Fed's current guidance. While inflation is cooling, it remains stubbornly above target. However, we expect upcoming weaker employment data will provide room for this additional rate cut. Bond Vigilantes: Will Borrowing Costs Force the Fed’s Hand? The risk of bond vigilantes reemerging is hard to ignore as persistent deficits and rising interest burdens test investor patience. Historically, these market enforcers—who punish fiscal laxity by offloading bonds and driving yields higher—have pushed borrowing costs to levels that demand a policy response, most notably during the 1980s and 1990s when debt burdens matched today's levels. Now, with the Congressional Budget Interest Costs Near Vigilante Territory Office (CBO) projecting interest expense to breach 4% of GDP in the next decade, surpassing peaks seen during prior vigilante episodes, the stakes are rising. Notably, this CBO projection is a baseline forecast, assuming no further tax cuts and lower Treasury yields—conditions that may prove overly optimistic. Could the Federal Reserve intervene? Absolutely. If yields surge uncontrollably, the Fed might counter with asset purchases, quantitative easing, or even yield curve control—explicitly capping rates at targeted levels to stabilize borrowing costs. So far, bond auctions remain stable, with no signs of tailing, suggesting investors are still on board. But how long can this balance last? If vigilantes return, the Fed may face an unprecedented challenge to hold the line. Portfolio Perspective Higher debt servicing costs and a weak labor market may flip the Federal Reserve back toward dovish forward guidance and unconventional measures, like yield curve control or expanded asset purchases, to stabilize borrowing costs and economic growth.

We expect the trend towards asset tokenization to accelerate in 2025, with tokenized RWAs topping $30B. On-chain money market funds are poised to be the fastest growing category. A key factor behind this growth will be the introduction of Ethena’s USDtb stablecoin, backed by BlackRock’s BUIDL fund.
