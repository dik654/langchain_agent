{"text": "Executive Summary Functionised has been providing exceptional health and fitness services to individuals for over seven years now1, with its founders researching and applying in others for decades. In that time and for decades before leading up to its formation, we have developed a deep understanding of both the global obesity pandemic and the psychological struggles individuals face. Our mission is to encourage, not force, humans across the globe to be more mindful and responsible for their health. We believe that, with the right approach, we can not only reduce the financial burden placed on the world but also improve the lives of those who choose to commit to their health and fitness. To do this, we use wearable technology to track and reward individuals who achieve their daily health goals. We call these rewards $FITS. This is an acronym for Functionised Integrative Tokens (hereinafter referred to as FIT). We believe that, with this strategy, we can finally disrupt the ever-growing obesity pandemic. We believe in the power of collective decentralization to build something stronger than a centralized team could ever create. A community-run token is nothing without the united individuals who give it purpose. It's been understood that humans thrive in packs and when it comes to health and fitness; these are some of the strongest communities and bonds found anywhere in the world. We are proud of how Functionised originated and equally excited for our future. Starting with nothing means everyone has to bring something to the table. The supporters and believers in our mission have been the source of all our successes. Functionised and $FITS solves the following problems: 1. Reduce the $4 trillion global burden by lowering healthcare costs associated with being overweight and/ or obese by lowering the risk and incidence of disease directly correlated to being overweight or obese. 2. Improve productivity through improved mental clarity, decreased negative mental illness, and/ or thought patterns directly correlated with individuals who are overweight or obese. Productivity will also be improved by eliminating overweight and obese conditions through improved daily energy, no longer going towards simply carrying around voluntary excess weight. 3. Improve satisfaction of life through the direct correlation of increased endorphins and overall happiness in those who are considered “fit” by achieving and maintaining an indefinite approved healthy body mass index score (BMI).2 1https://wyobiz.wyo.gov/Business/FilingDetails.aspx?eFNum=195249065073171062078165253 21600910 7017060007219 2https://www.worldobesityday.org/assets/downloads/World_Obesity_Atlas_2023_Report.pdf 3 FITS Global Holdings Inc..

{"text": "The Big Picture and the Global Pandemic Being overweight and obese is now a global pandemic that has no actionable plan, other than increasing clothing sizes (thus requiring more natural resources and further depleting the planet as a whole and driving up costs). Through the media and marketing, humans are encouraged to become apathetic to their plight. Our main aim is to truly eliminate this voluntary pandemic and reduce this plight. The statistics presented in the World Obesity Federation's 2023 atlas are staggering and disheartening. The fact that over 1.9 billion adults were overweight in 2016 is a cause for concern, but the prediction that 4 billion people will be affected by 2035 is alarming. It is a problem that affects every country in the world, regardless of income level.3 One of the main concerns is that lower-income countries and communities are seeing the highest increase in obesity rates. This can be attributed to many factors, including lack of access to healthy foods and opportunities for physical activity but most of all depressive states that cause individuals to self-medicate with excess calorie consumption and decreased physical activity. However, this problem is not isolated to low-income areas. No country has reported a decline in obesity prevalence across its entire population, making it clear that this is a problem that affects us all. While the World Health Organization (WHO) has introduced new comprehensive recommendations to address this problem, uneducated to the degree necessary and most often overweight themselves; politicians telling people what to do through new government spending bills is not going to improve one's health. We must increase efforts to prevent, manage and treat obesity throughout the life course. This action must be decisive, people-centered, centralized through decentralization and integrated to have any real chance of success. Preventing and treating obesity will indeed require financial investment, but the cost of not addressing this issue will be far greater. Overweight and obesity are projected to cost the global economy over $4 trillion in potential income in 2035. That is nearly 3% of the current global GDP.4 It is important to note that the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated this problem. Lockdowns and restrictions have increased the risk of weight gain, as people felt they were forced to spend more time at home and have used this as an excuse to reduce physical activity and eating high-quality foods to the limits that one's body requires. The rise in obesity prevalence, especially among children, is cause for concern and suggests that the pandemic has had 3https://www.worldobesityday.org/assets/downloads/World_Obesity_Atlas_2023_Report.pdf 4OECD (2019), The Heavy Burden of Obesity: The Economics of Prevention, OECD Health Policy 4 FITS Global Holdings Inc..

{"text": "unintended consequences that may prove hard to reverse. The rising prevalence of obesity among children and adolescents is particularly concerning. It is estimated that by 2035, 20% of the world's boys and 18% of the world's girls will be affected. We must take action now to prevent this from happening.5 Obesity is a problem that affects every country and community in the world, and we must take action to prevent, manage and treat obesity through the elimination of obesity on this planet. The cost of inaction is simply too great. It is time to come together to find solutions to this problem and ensure a healthier future for all. $FITS is the solution. The Government Centralization Model of Health Never Worked As far back as 1912, the United States government had attempted at controlling individuals’ health when some believe Teddy Roosevelt proposed social and health insurance. We are continuously bombarded with health fallacies and propaganda to achieve not true health but instead have seen the results of a long history of poor health, resulting in pain and suffering through increased rates of obesity. While the original food guidelines were set in Sweden in 1974.6 A very similar guideline was published in 1992 in the United States, known as the Food Pyramid. In 2005 this was updated and more recently, the My Plate was introduced in 2011.7 While this was a better update, it is still inaccurate for the entire population as a whole as it over-exemplifies the importance of fruits and vegetables (toxic laden, high in obesity causing sugar, and low in absorbable nutrients) and ignores free-range end grass finished meats and a healthy amount of plants. Food recommendations are also considered for a population as a whole and do not take into account genetic variables, such as those seen in the Functionised Productions movie, The Keto Project Movie (release date 2025)8. Another problem with government recommendations on health and fitness, using food guides as an example, is that these guidelines have been created and influenced by special interest groups. Lobbyists have greatly influenced these guidelines for profit as opposed to human health as the only deciding factor. Finally, simply because there are guidelines and recommendations does not mean humans will follow them. What is the purpose and what is the ultimate motivating factor? Simply because 5 Chang et al, 2021. Weight Gain Associated with COVID-19 Lockdown in Children and Adolescents: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.

{"text": "someone knows what is healthy for them in no way causes them to make the healthy decision when unhealthy choices (known to be unhealthy or not) surround the individual daily. Creating a utility cryptocurrency that rewards people daily for achieving quantified positive health metrics is an innovative way to create long-term sustainable lifestyles. Such a currency could be used to incentivize healthy habits and reward those who stay on track with their health goals thus creating new habits that can be perpetual. This will be achieved through a platform that combines data from fitness trackers, health apps, and other sources to reward users with usable tokens for meeting certain health-related goals/ metrics. This could be a great way to encourage healthier lifestyles and help people make positive, lasting changes in their lives. The Challenge The challenge in any crypto project is functionality. It is important to create a currency that is accepted globally and can be used to purchase goods and services, particularly those related to healthcare and fitness. Insurance companies refuse to pay for preventative and longevity care. This token gives the ability to the individual to pay for it themselves through their lifestyle efforts. The ultimate goal is to create a non-fungible token that can be used to not only purchase health and fitness services and products but purchase food deemed appropriate for a healthy lifestyle, as determined by health research experts and not any organization with the potential for bias. It is essential to create a currency that is accepted across global markets to maximize its potential. The solution to implementing token functionality is garnering a need for existing businesses to accept a form of payment outside of the current paradigm of accepting only the equivalent of the country's currency in which they operate. A very educated yet hungry and motivated team must be formed and implemented to personally visit and encourage business owners across the globe to accept this form of currency as a benefit to them and their company. By accepting this token, the business will garner a new market of opportunity driving new sales. They may also utilize the token for B2B or personal goods and services while also maintaining the ability to swap currencies for the currency of their choosing.

To achieve this, we have developed a strategy based on: 1. Adopting current technologies, which are at the same time highly reliable, affordable, and easy to operate. 2. Encouraging the global population and providing them incentives to help us deploy this network and manage their sensors in a fast and cost-effective way. In Each Location, We Proceed as Follows: We partner with influencers and community leaders to raise awareness for a healthier and more fit world and to select FIT ambassadors among reputable individuals who recruit others supporting our efforts. Network Setup Health and fitness sensors are utilized in the form of wearable sensors from existing products on the market today. Systems are thoroughly tested. Value From Data $FITS leverages advanced technologies and the engagement of local communities to raise the standards of healthy monitoring. By encouraging citizens to operate sensors and earn rewards for data streams we can deploy dense, real-time sensor networks and deliver hyperlocal, street-level data quickly and cost-effectively. Moreover, we enable “Healthy Globe as a Service” solutions and implement a circular, “green data” economy where citizens make their community healthier and fitter and reap immediate benefits from their commitment. Data transmitted is validated, analyzed, and written on the Polygon 2.0 (formerly MATIC) Blockchain (initially). It is planned to build the Functionised blockchain (if necessary) and move the token over to a coin when the time is right. Sensor owners receive FIT rewards, which can be used as an official currency of health, wellness, fitness, longevity and insurance rewards to make purchases as Bitcoin (BTC) was intended.

{"text": "Tokenomics Functionised Integrative Token’s are issued on the polygon blockchain. FIT’s are earned when a sensor (wearable device) sends valid quality data to Functionised. Principles Before considering how FIT design should evolve, it is essential to first establish a set of guiding principles. Good tokenomics for FIT should incentivize and reward positive contributions to the network such as users who generate valuable data, spend within the marketplace (global economy who accepts FIT at point of sale), and developers that build apps and integrations. In addition, it should not deter other participants such as healthcare and fitness professionals and app developers and should remain a neutral, open, and reasonably priced platform for them to build on. Furthermore, tokenomics should be: 1. Sustainable. A token burn will not result in a future with no tokens remaining. 2. Be reasonably predictable- the token supply should cause immediate inflation and the cost to utilize FIT shouldn’t wildly fluctuate. 3. Be implementable- tokenomics must be technologically feasible, commercially enforceable, and comply with regulations 4. Vest authority with a decentralized and aligned community of stakeholders. 5. Be transparent and basic for the general public to understand. Tokenomics Mechanisms It's time to embrace the power of tokenomic mechanisms that comply with the principles and can be deployed in any combination with one another, ensuring that each principle is fully covered. We must move past the industry's traditional reluctance to embrace uncertainty in protocol design and leverage the advanced use cases and governance structures of protocols like Functionised to safely and iteratively improve the token design. Just as we wouldn't expect Google to limit its budget for the next century, we should not impose such limitations on networks that exist in a dynamic environment.

{"text": "Booting up a two-sided market is a big challenge. It's difficult to generate demand without supply or build up supply without demand. For $FITS to be successful, it needs to establish a supply of user and connected wearables on one side and create interest in the human performance data and connectivity on the other. Helium demonstrated how decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) can support the supply side of a network with token rewards while the demand side matures. $FITS Rewards were designed to achieve the same outcome. Each week, tokens are issued to users just for simply moving. Longer-term rewards are rewarded with reaching for higher metrics are rewarded with more FITs. With many projects baseline rewards can be used as a promotional strategy, where the award amount gradually decreases over time as demand increases. In that case, we are not playing these games. The promotion is being rewarded for doing the things humans should be doing daily regardless. The user is being positively rewarded for reprogramming faults and correcting them with a truly healthier lifestyle. Stable $FITS as an Alternative Token Many crypto projects fail due to lack of efficacy, which leads to drop in price. In this age of instant gratification, few stick with a token/ coin long term as a result. We offer an adjusted rewards token that will closely mirror the USD regarding daily payouts. The amount of tokens created daily in the form of rewards. To preserve the value with a fluctuating market, we utilize algorithmic stability. If it appears the token’s value will drop, we will implement an additional burn (as opposed to a buy back). As will be seen in the tokenomics section, there will also be a burn each day regarding tokens that had potential to be earned but instead resulted in a failure by the user to earn them by performing basic healthy lifestyle habits. Metaphorically, this is a true “burn”. Flat Protocol Fees Part of why so many crypto projects fail is because they continuously integrate fiat currency as solutions as opposed to having full faith in the network. In this case, we believe in $FITS and will capture any network fees for various on-chain actions, such as transferring or adding devices, etc., in our native token. The user's confidence should help bolster the long-term stability of this fungible token. Flat fees have the benefit of being easy to enforce and the drawback of being unrelated to the value created in those transactions. For example, should sending 10,000,000 ETH cost as much as it does to send one? Both a feature (fairness) and a bug (regressive).

Each year hundreds of millions of individuals realize how unhappy they are for being obese. Even the smallest fees could generate billions in revenue at scale. Lock-up for Licenses Parties that require the trust of FIT participants should have skin in the game and a long-term incentive to do the right thing. To accomplish this, licensees should be required as a personal commitment deposit. This will ensure that they remain long-term holders of the token and face consequences, if they misbehave. This will be achieved via app subscriptions, which are to be viewed as licensing. The user will pay the Apple Store or Google Play store a small fee to use the app and enjoy $FITS as added benefits of a healthy lifestyle. There will also be a 48 hour hold period for rewards to be available to avoid daily conversions to another token or USD. Human Data as a Service Human performance data and connectivity are valuable, and apps and data consumers will pay to get it. These connections can either be monetized with a universally defined fee structure or a revenue-sharing agreement. Personal identification data will not be shared. Fee structure For example, a fee structure might be arranged such that it’s free for certain volumes and types of data, then USD 0.25 worth of $FITS per user per month to stream its anonymous metrics, and another $0.25 to stream its telemetry data. Both Helium and Hivemapper use such a format for assigning a fixed price to a unit of data. Similar to both, $FITS could introduce a data credit for each data type that simplifies the process of spending $FITS. Revenue share Functionised looks to employ a revenue share arrangement whereby Functionised Infrastructure Inc., the first licensed node operator, helps to store and sell aggregate and anonymized user data for the best rates it can get, passing along 90% of the revenue to users in $FITS.

In the future, these fees could be reallocated and flow back into the treasury, get burned, go directly to the users selling their data, and/or top up rewards pools. Sound tokenomics must do more than just extract fees wherever possible and reward contributors; they must also be sustainable, avoiding burning away completely and creating an outflow of resources that are out of balance. Currently, there is no automated rebalancing mechanism in place, so token holders must vote on specific interventions to adjust the Baseline Rewards formula, reallocate tokens, and other measures to keep flows in balance.

{"text": "*Payouts received daily from 48 hours previous to eliminate “cheating” and quick token drops. **Nutrition arrangements will begin in stage 2. Competitive Analysis Sweatcoin is the primary competitor in the fitness reward sector, but it lacks blockchain-backed transparency, does not support decentralized data ownership, and has an unclear revenue model. In contrast, $FITS operates on the Polygon blockchain, ensuring secure transactions, user-controlled data privacy, and a sustainable token economy. With a clear revenue model that includes subscription fees, transaction fees, and future data monetization, $FITS is poised to become the dominant force in this space. Tokenomics & Economic Stability The $FITS tokenomics model is designed to balance token distribution, liquidity, and economic stability. The initial market cap is set at $10 million, with a liquidity pool structured to ensure stability. The liquidity pool allocations consist of 80% USDC to $FITS, providing a stable price floor, and 20% Polygon to $FITS, maintaining blockchain ecosystem integration. The token allocation is structured to support long-term growth, with 50% reserved for rewards and ecosystem expansion, 20% dedicated to development and marketing, 15% allocated to the team with a three-year vesting schedule, and 15% set aside for liquidity reserves. Controlled emissions ensure that new token minting is based on demand, preventing inflation and maintaining long-term value. Technology & Security The $FITS platform is built on the Polygon Layer-2 blockchain, ensuring scalability, low transaction costs, and energy efficiency. Security is a top priority, with GDPR and HIPAA-compliant anonymized data collection protocols. To enhance privacy, Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) are implemented to verify transactions without revealing sensitive personal information. The use of smart contracts guarantees that rewards are distributed fairly and transparently. Revenue Model & Business Strategy The $FITS revenue model is structured around three primary income streams: the $2.99 monthly app subscription, the 5% transaction fee on wallet transfers, and future monetization of anonymized health and fitness data. Additionally, strategic partnerships with health and fitness, grocery and research brands will provide further opportunities for revenue growth, including co-branded opportunities and sponsored incentives. 17 FITS Global Holdings Inc..

{"text": "This plan ensures that $FITS can launch successfully with $10,000 USD while supporting user rewards and creating a foundation for long-term growth. Privacy Privacy remains an essential element of any financial system, and the traditional banking model offers a high degree of privacy by limiting access to information to only those involved and any trusted third party. However, this is not possible with the requirement to announce all transactions publicly. Nevertheless, privacy can still be maintained by obscuring the link between the transaction and the parties involved. This is similar to the level of information released by stock exchanges, where the time and size of individual trades are made public without revealing the identities of the parties involved. To further strengthen security, a new key pair should be used for each transaction to prevent them from being linked back to the same owner. Unfortunately, multi-input transactions will still reveal that all the inputs belong to the same owner, leaving the risk of linking other transactions if the key owner is identified. 19 FITS Global Holdings Inc..
