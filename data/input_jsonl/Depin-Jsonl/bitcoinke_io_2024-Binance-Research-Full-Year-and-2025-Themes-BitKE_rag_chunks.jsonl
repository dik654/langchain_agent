{"text": "01 / Key Takeaways ● In 2024, the crypto industry experienced significant growth, with market capitalization rising by 96.2% year-on-year (YoY), driven by strong gains in the first and fourth quarters. The launch of spot BTC ETFs in the U.S. in January marked a pivotal moment, boosting market sentiment and attracting new capital. Favorable macro conditions, including the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate cut in September and positive regulatory expectations post-U.S. Presidential election, further propelled the market. Key narratives included the points meta, restaking, memecoins, AI agents, and stablecoins. Looking ahead, we are monitoring global monetary policies, regulatory changes, new ETF approvals, and the emergence of crypto-specific narratives. ● Bitcoin had an eventful 2024, bookmarked by the U.S. spot ETF approvals in January, and the breaking of the long-anticipated US$100K mark in December. The ETFs proved historically successful, attracting around US$35B in net inflows and boasting over US$105B in total assets. Bitcoin dominance exceeded 60%, a level unseen since 2021. Performance versus traditional assets remained extremely impressive, leading almost all traditional investments. On the demand side, the 4 th Halving event halved annual Bitcoin issuance, while the Bitcoin ecosystem bloomed, including a 2,000%+ rise in DeFi total value locked. As we look ahead, the growing maturity of the ETFs, the incoming Donald Trump administration (perhaps aided by a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve or further corporate Bitcoin adoption), and a growing Bitcoin ecosystem around Layer 2s (L2s), Decentralized Finance (DeFi), and more, are some factors that excite us. ● In 2024, Ethereum led alt-L1s in metrics like market cap, trading volume, and DeFi TVL, while activity metrics such as daily transactions and active addresses were dominated by Solana, which also offers the lowest average transaction fee. In 2025, the U.S. Ether ETFs, the potential for more dApps in launching their own chain, the Pectra Upgrade, and Ethereum's prioritization dilemma are key stories to consider. Solana broke fee and DEX volume all-time highs multiple times in 2024 and developer interest grew significantly, however, stablecoins on the chain remained relatively low. Their new upcoming client, Firedancer, network extensions (i.e., Solana L2s), and SVM stack chains are important stories to follow. BNB chain saw scalability progress with opBNB and data storage development with Greenfield. Sui outgrew Aptos, while Avalanche saw its largest update yet with Avalanche9000. Tron was strong in stablecoin transactions (although saw its position challenged). TON, which slowed in H2 2024, remains important to watch, alongside the launches of Berachain and Monad. ● For L2s, 2024 was earmarked by a plethora of token generation events across both the optimistic and zero knowledge types, with over nine major L2 token launches taking place over the course of the year. It was, however, the Base L2 that stole the limelight in 2024. Despite its lack of a token, Base grew to capture 39% and 67% of the market in terms of total value locked (TVL) and daily active users respectively, Full-Year 2024 & Themes for 2025 4", "metadata": {"source_file": "bitcoinke_io_2024-Binance-Research-Full-Year-and-2025-Themes-BitKE.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/bitcoinke_io_2024-Binance-Research-Full-Year-and-2025-Themes-BitKE.pdf", "page_number": 5, "chunk_id": "bitcoinke_io_2024-Binance-Research-Full-Year-and-2025-Themes-BitKE_p5_c1", "title": "Full-Year Report 2024 - Google Docs", "creationDate": "D:20250120132837+00'00'"}}
{"text": "making it the top L2 in both metrics. With many of the airdrop rewards now behind us, 2025 will tell which L2s can sustain user activity and capital without relying heavily on token incentives. ● 2024 has marked a robust recovery for DeFi, driven by a substantial influx of capital that propelled total value locked up by 119.7% year-to-date (YTD) to US$119.3B. This resurgence has sparked a renaissance across DeFi sub-sectors, with core areas like Money Markets and Decentralized Exchanges (DEXes) reaching new milestones. The year has been defined by the emergence of previously inaccessible on-chain financial primitives, the narrowing gap between DeFi and Centralized Exchange (CEX)-like experiences, increased adoption by both consumers and institutions, and heightened protocol competition. Together, these developments are paving the way for DeFi to find product-market fit and deliver tangible impact in the real-world. ● The stablecoins market experienced remarkable growth in 2024, reaching an all-time high market cap of US$205B and ended the year just slightly lower at US$204B, representing a 56.8% YoY increase. USDT, the leading stablecoin, saw a 50.2% increase in market cap but lost some market share to USDC, which grew by 82.4% and experienced a 3% absolute increase in market share. Ethena's USDe, launched in December 2023, quickly became the third-largest stablecoin with a market cap of approximately US$5.9B. ● In 2024, the gaming sector experienced modest growth, with the total gaming token market cap increasing by 44%, underperforming the overall crypto market which grew by 96.2% YoY. Despite the relatively slower pace of growth, the Web3 gaming industry saw notable developments. The number of unique active wallets (UAWs) interacting with games increased by 580% throughout the year, reaching over 50 million by year-end. Additionally, hundreds of new titles were announced across major gaming ecosystems and platforms, with standout titles like \"Off the Grid\" bringing Web3 gaming into mainstream appeal for the first time. ● Memecoins were the top performing crypto sub-sector in 2024 (+212%) and dominated mindshare. The top memecoins are split between Solana and Ethereum, although Ethereum still hosts the top three, including Dogecoin, which is in its fourth cycle. Solana has become the default memecoin trading chain, driven by a cohesive and unfragmented product suite and consistently cheap fees. The incredible growth of Pump.fun has also been key to the success, with the memecoin launchpad having seen 5.7M+ memecoins and over US$400M in revenue in 2024. ● AI agents, initially sparked by Truth Terminal and $GOAT, have captured the market since October and become a dominant narrative. Infrastructure providers like Virtuals Protocol (G.A.M.E. framework) and ai16z (ElizaOS framework) have been key players. The first agents have largely focused around market commentary (aixbt) or entertainment (Luna, Eliza), with lots more in development. Swarms (groups of agents), the entry of web2 into AI agents, and the rapid development and anticipated trajectory of AI x crypto, are key areas to watch. ● While speculation-driven SocialFi platforms initially spurred user growth, 2024 became a year of consolidation for Decentralized Social (DeSoc).

However, dApps on social networks like Farcaster showed steadier growth, emerging as bright spots in the sector. These platforms shifted toward developer-centric value propositions — focused on front-end composability, distribution, and integration into existing UX through products like Frames and Blinks — which could play a key role in driving adoption in 2025. ● DePIN has demonstrated real-world applications in areas such as compute, telecommunication, and energy, attracting notable interest and investment. Despite a diverse landscape with 249 projects, some DePIN initiatives face challenges in generating meaningful revenue, indicating varying levels of demand. ● Web3 projects attracted a total of 1,432 investments, amassing a collective capital of US$9.2B in 2024. Of this, nearly US$4B was invested in infrastructure projects, accounting for around 44% of total funds raised in 2024. This was followed by DeFi with US$1.5B (16% of funds raised) and Games with US$0.8B (9% of funds raised). ● In 2025, eight key themes are particularly exciting to us, and we anticipate significant progress in these areas throughout the year.

These helped to add a new source of institutional demand to the Bitcoin market, a factor that has enhanced the diversity and depth of investment interest compared to previous cycles . U.S.-based institutional investors, from hedge funds to pension funds, now have a simpler, more direct, and straightforward way to access crypto markets. Since the ETF structure is familiar and comfortable for institutional investors, it is thus an ideal way to introduce conservative investors to crypto markets. Overall, the Bitcoin ETFs have recorded US$35B+ of net inflows since the January 2024 launch, with volumes having surpassed US$650B (4), while total assets under management is over US$105B.

Meanwhile, European crypto ETPs — roughly equivalent to U.S. spot ETFs and available since 2015 — are experiencing significant growth, with total AUM (6) rising ~97% from ~US$9B in 2023 to over US$17B in 2024 . Two key factors could drive bullish momentum for Bitcoin ETFs in 2025. First, the one-year anniversary of U.S. spot ETFs marks a potential turning point. While traditional investors were initially cautious when onboarding crypto, the performance in 2024 has likely built confidence. This could prompt more investors to diversify into Bitcoin ETFs in the coming months. In addition, the recent presidential victory of pro-crypto Donald Trump has heightened bullishness across the U.S. (especially with regards to Bitcoin). Following this sentiment, Bitcoin broke the US$100K mark, with ETF flows reaching yearly highs after the election victory. We may see more of this sentiment come through in the coming months which may result in further traditional investor involvement. With a relatively low barrier to entry, Bitcoin ETFs offer traditional investors a simple way to dip their toes into crypto. As a result, we expect ETF flows to continue growing. The Halving Bitcoin operates on a fixed issuance schedule, a key feature of its appeal. A set amount of Bitcoin is rewarded to miners for validating each block, known as the block reward. Every 210,000 blocks — approximately every four years — this reward is halved, reducing the rate of new Bitcoin issuance by 50%. This event, called the “Bitcoin Halving,” is a pivotal moment in the crypto world. As Bitcoin has a capped supply of 21 million, the halving plays a critical role in its monetary policy, with significant implications for miners, investors, and the broader market. For a deeper dive, check out The Future of Bitcoin #1: The Halving & What’s Next . Figure 8: Bitcoin’s block reward has decreased from 50 BTC per block to 3.125 BTC per block across its first four Halving events Source: Binance Research Given that Bitcoin miners derive the majority of their income from the block reward, the Halving represents a direct ~50% reduction in their income.

Since the April 2024 Halving, we have observed an increasing trend of miners diversifying into providing AI and high performance computing (HPC)(7) infrastructure, as well as, larger miners attempting to acquire or merge with smaller competitors. We will likely see a continuation of this in 2025, especially with regards to providing AI-related computational power and services. The Halving likely doubles as a global campaign emphasizing Bitcoin’s inflation-resistant, self-enforced monetary policy . It highlights Bitcoin’s fixed supply and growing demand, drawing attention to its scarcity. At a time when Bitcoin is more accessible to investors than ever, the Halving reinforces its unique value proposition.

Developers have long aimed to expand Bitcoin’s utility, with significant progress seen in 2023 and 2024. ● Ordinals & Runes: Casey Rodarmor’s “Ordinal Theory” enabled the tracking of individual Satoshis (the smallest unit of Bitcoin), and ascribed a unique identifier to every single one. These individual Satoshis were then able to be “inscribed” with arbitrary content such as text, images, and videos. This created an “Inscription ” or what soon became known as a Bitcoin NFT. Initially launched in late 2022, these saw significant attention across 2023. ○ In late 2023, the BRC-20 standard was introduced, enabling the deployment, minting, transfer of Ordinal-linked fungible tokens on Bitcoin. ○ Building on this development, the Runes Protocol launched in April 2024, coinciding with the Bitcoin Halving. Created by Casey Rodarmor, Runes offer another approach to creating fungible tokens on the Bitcoin network.

This is especially important in light of the recent Bitcoin halving. As a reminder, Bitcoin miners are compensated in two different ways: block rewards and transaction fees, with the block rewards halving every four years. The April 2024 halving reduced this from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. Thus, an increase in transaction fees is required in order to sustain the miners, given the block reward will eventually reduce to zero. ○ To learn more about Runes, Ordinals, and BRC-20s, you can check out these reports: (1) The Future of Bitcoin #2: Tokens, (2) BRC-20 Tokens: a Primer, and (3) A New Era for Bitcoin? ● Layer 2s (L2s): One of the indirect effects of Ordinals, BRC-20s, and Runes has been the ushering in of a new renaissance for Bitcoin expressivity. However, an issue arises due to the inherent technical limitations of Bitcoin, which does not support smart contracts in the same way as alt-L1s like Ethereum, Solana, and BNB Chain does. What this means is that a lot of work is being done on creating alternative layers for Bitcoin expressivity, i.e., Bitcoin L2s. ○ Various teams are working on solutions, including long-standing teams such as Lightning Network, Stacks, and RGB. Newer teams are also emerging with innovative solutions, including Citrea and Merlin’s Bitcoin zk-rollups.

{"text": "○ While some teams have launched testnets, many are still in the development phase. We expect to see further launches and traction in 2025. ○ Also worth mentioning is the introduction of BitVM and BitVM 2. . BitVM’s goal is to scale the Bitcoin network through introducing smart contract capabilities, without requiring significant changes to Bitcoin’s existing infrastructure. BitVM operates somewhat similarly to how we understand optimistic rollups on other L1 chains. Development around this protocol may help expand Bitcoin’s capabilities far ahead of where they are now, and also help create a more secure way to bridge BTC to secondary layers. Although it is relatively early in BitVM’s history to see where it will go, this is an important area to keep up with through 2025. ● DeFi: The Bitcoin DeFi or BTCFi space is another to keep a close eye on. 2024 was a breakout year for the sector, with TVL growing by over 2,000% from US$0.3B to over US$6.5B(10) , cementing Bitcoin’s place among the top five DeFi chains.

We are likely to see this activity continue to bump up across 2025, with many more product launches expected. What may 2025 bring? There are a number of catalysts for Bitcoin (and the broader crypto ecosystem) as we head into 2025. A key driver here is the U.S. and what is expected from the incoming Donald Trump government. Given Donald Trump has multiple NFT collections and a DeFi project, and a record number of pro-crypto have been elected officials across the House of Representatives and Senate, U.S. crypto regulation developments are expected in 2025. Enacting clear regulation of digital assets is expected to bring more clarity to TradFi institutions and benefit existing crypto ETFs and potentially allow for more to be created. Taking into account the U.S.’ major position across global financial markets and improved sentiment towards crypto, similar developments in many other countries across the world are expected to follow. Focusing specifically on Bitcoin: ● Strategic Bitcoin Reserve: This was a product of Senator Cynthia Lummis’ bill to create such a reserve in the U.S. and has been mentioned numerous times by Donald Trump during his Presidential campaign trail. ○ Interestingly, a number of different U.S. states are working on their own legislation to create Bitcoin reserves on a state-level. This includes Pennsylvania, Florida, Ohio, and Texas (11) . ○ Perhaps even more importantly, the issue is being discussed in various nations globally. There has been discussion and bills proposed in Brazil, the Czech Republic, Poland, Russia, (12), with speculation in other countries including China. ○ There has been a rise in corporate Bitcoin adoption (13) , with many firms joining MicroStrategy in adding Bitcoin to their treasuries. This includes the likes of Semler Scientific, Metaplanet, Genius Group, etc. Many Bitcoin miners, including Riot and Marathon, have also been purchasing more Bitcoin for their treasuries, while others like streaming company Rumble are also considering implementing the strategy. ● More Ecosystem Development: As we mentioned previously, there is significant traction across Bitcoin L2s, Bitcoin DeFi, and other parts of the ecosystem. With increasing global attention on the largest cryptocurrency, as well as increasing flows from traditional investors (owing to the ETFs), we expect to see further development across the broader Bitcoin ecosystem in 2025.

{"text": "● Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs): BIPs are formal proposals sent to the Bitcoin community describing potential new features that could be added to Bitcoin. For example, Bitcoin’s last two major upgrades, SegWit (2017) and Taproot (2021) implemented a number of BIPs into Bitcoin. These upgrades were essential to the creation of Ordinals, BRC-20s, and Runes. ○ An important BIP to track is BIP-347(14), which seeks to implement OP_CAT to Bitcoin. To put it very simply, OP_CAT can allow Bitcoin to combine two pieces of data during a transaction, potentially unlocking smart contract capabilities across the network. OP_CAT is one of many “ covenant” proposals, which create additional conditions and rules around how Bitcoin can be spent, thereby creating the possibilities for more advanced logic within the network. ○ Although Bitcoin traditionally moves very slowly and carefully, covenants have been discussed for over ten years and have received renewed attention over the last couple of years following the Ordinals-led boom. It will be interesting to watch if one or more new BIPs can be introduced or at least gain further traction across 2025 .

Figure 15: Current ETH Performance Lags Behind Previous Market Cycles Source: Glassnode, Binance Research, as of December 31, 2024 The Impact of Dencun Ethereum’s Dencun hard fork went live in March 2024, introducing various changes to the network. The most anticipated was EIP-4844 (a.k.a. proto-danksharding), allowing users to benefit from lower gas fees on L2 transactions. This was a major milestone for Ethereum’s road to scalability and lays the groundwork for full danksharding in the future. Specifically, EIP-4844 introduced “ blobs,” which provide L2s with a more gas-efficient way to post transaction data. Blobs drastically reduced fees for posting data to Ethereum’s L1, enabling L2s to support higher transactions per second (TPS) and attract increased user activity. Blobs achieve this by storing the bulk of data off-chain and employing a pricing mechanism called “blob gas” that operates independently from Ethereum’s gas market. Additionally, data is stored temporarily for around two weeks rather than permanently.

Due to general interoperability challenges across crypto, this has contributed to somewhat complex user experiences. For example, how does one explain the difference between Arbitrum USDT, Base USDT, zkSync USDT, and the fact that these are all a form of Ethereum USDT to crypto newbies? Other than newbies, some seasoned crypto users even expressed fatigue with the sprawling Ethereum L2 ecosystem. In contrast, monolithic and fully integrated alt-L1s, where dApps operate in shared environments and offer Web2-like experiences, have gained traction i.e., Solana (discussed later in this report). It remains to be seen whether L2s will continue their momentum in 2025 or if attention will shift back to Ethereum L1. Make sure to check out our recent report, The ETH Value Debate, for more on this topic and a wider Ethereum discussion. The End of Ultrasound Money? Lower transaction fees have also impacted ETH’s inflation dynamics. Ethereum’s supply is governed by issuance, staking rewards, and the fee burn mechanism (EIP-1559). “Ultrasound Money” has been a long-standing narrative of many in the Ethereum and EVM communities, whereby the burn effect of EIP-1559 will outweigh the issuance of ETH, making it a deflationary asset.

This was initially observed through many parts of 2023, following The Merge in 2022, when Ethereum transitioned to proof-of-stake. However, with reduced fees following the Dencun Upgrade, the ETH burn rate has declined, reversing many of the deflationary trends observed 2023 . In fact, ETH issuance reached ~0.74% annually in September, a high not seen in two years, dampening the ultrasound money narrative that many in the Ethereum community pushed in 2022 and 2023(18).

Ethereum’s issuance rate remains below 1%, far lower than most alt-L1s. Furthermore, cyclical market activity should naturally restore the burn mechanism as demand picks up - something we have started to see in recent weeks. The key risk, however, lies in Ethereum’s ability to maintain consistent blockspace demand across cycles, particularly amid rising competition from alt-L1s and the increasing reliance on L2 activity.

Figure 19: Ether ETFs picked up in November and December, after a slow start Source: farside.co.uk, Binance Research. As of December 31, 2024. Overall, US spot ETH ETFs received a cumulative US$2.7B in net inflows (19) since their July 2024 launch, an overall success among the broad ETF universe. Total volumes surpassed US$43B, with total AUM upwards of US$11B (20). November and December were particularly strong months, bringing in over US$1.1B and US$2.1B in net inflows, respectively. While numbers improved significantly by the end of the year, we should note that spot BTC ETFs attracted ~13-14x higher net inflows than the ETH ETFs. Similar to the BTC ETFs, ETH ETFs stand to benefit from growing institutional interest as traditional finance becomes more comfortable with onboarding new asset classes, bolstered by the recent pro-crypto sentiment due to Trump’s recent victory. Additionally, there is also an additional catalyst in the form of staking. A key difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum is their respective consensus mechanisms, i.e., Bitcoin uses proof-of-work (PoW), whereas Ethereum uses proof-of-stake (PoS). This means that ETH holders who choose to stake their ETH are able to benefit from a native staking yield (something not available to BTC holders). However, as things stand, those who hold ETH ETFs in the U.S. are unable to stake and earn yield on their holdings. But, given that many in the market expect a more constructive and accommodative crypto environment in the U.S. with the new government, staking yield on ETFs is something that many are expecting to be approved in the coming year. If this occurs, the ETH ETFs will have a unique feature in comparison to their BTC counterparts, and we might expect to see an increase in inflows towards them.

{"text": "What’s Next? ● Pectra Upgrade: Scheduled for early 2025, Pectra consolidates two previously planned upgrades: Prague (focused on the execution layer) and Electra (focused on the consensus layer). Together, Pectra introduces a set of updates designed to achieve three key objectives: ○ Address critical shortcomings in Ethereum’s PoS protocol. ○ Enhance user experiences for interacting with smart contract dApps. ○ Further advance L2 scalability by increasing Ethereum’s data availability capacity. While the first two objectives aim to improve Ethereum’s overall functionality, the third reinforces its commitment to the rollup-centric roadmap. Two notable proposals included in Pectra specifically target scaling resources for L2s: ○ EIP-7742 : This proposal allows the Beacon Chain to dynamically adjust the network’s target and maximum blob gas limit without requiring major hard forks. ○ EIP-7691: This increases the maximum blob count (currently capped at 6 blobs per block with a target of 3), further scaling Ethereum’s DA layer. With a higher blob count, the base blob fee would increase in a more controlled manner during periods of peak demand, enabling smoother price adjustments. While Pectra’s scope is streamlined (inc. continuation of prior blobspace upgrades), it is not expected to have an outsized impact on ETH value in the short-term. However, beyond Pectra, several forthcoming initiatives may have more direct implications. These include efforts to reduce issuance through stake ratio targeting, improve censorship resistance, and advancing scaling capabilities via Peer Data Availability Sampling (PeerDAS). ● More app-chains? Some dApps have turned to application-specific chains (app-chains) to meet higher performance requirements or vertically integrate their ecosystems, allowing them to capture a larger share of user and order flow. By leaving — or not opting for — Ethereum’s L1, these dApps forgo fee value accrual to the Ethereum ecosystem. ○ Notable examples include dYdX and Hyperliquid, but the most significant upcoming move is Uniswap’s shift to Unichain (21). As one of Ethereum’s largest gas consumers, Uniswap has historically made a substantial contribution to its fee pool.

Something to keep an eye on. ● The Prioritization Dilemma: Ethereum’s broad ambitions pose another challenge, as it simultaneously pursues multiple market spaces(22) . This challenge arises from the prioritization dilemma: should Ethereum focus on L2s to enhance blobspace and compete with alt-DA layers, or prioritize L1 improvements to strengthen the execution layer and contend with alt-L1s? This strategic ambiguity has a direct bearing on ETH’s value accrual. ○ This divergence of focus between multiple key areas introduces uncertainty, which can weigh on market confidence. While pursuing many areas concurrently is theoretically possible, following multiple paths risks diluting focus and slowing progress, particularly when competing protocols excel in specialized niches. ○ Without clear directional alignment, there are risks of overextending efforts and spreading value too thin, reducing the likelihood of achieving any single vision effectively.

Figure 25: Solana’s monthly real economic value (transaction fees + MEV tips) grew significantly 2024 Source: Blockworks Research, Binance Research, as of December 31, 2024 Memecoins Memecoins have been one of the leading narratives of this cycle and saw an explosion across 2024. As we will see later in this report, memecoins were the top performing sub-sector in 2024, with a year-to-date return of over 200%. Solana has been central to the growth of the memecoin markets , with many traders choosing it as their blockchain of choice when trading memes. There are multiple factors at play here, with the relatively cheap transaction fees and the cohesive and unfragmented product suite, being key highlights. Solana’s leading non-custodial wallet, Phantom, has also been important, with its simple user experience being a key factor. Having expanded from Solana to also supporting Ethereum, Polygon, Base, and Bitcoin, Phantom has further announced (24) upcoming support for Sui and Monad this year. ● Pump.fun: Solana’s native memecoin launchpad, Pump.fun, has been integral to the story, providing users a cheap and near-instant way to launch memecoins. Traders also benef it from each token being a fair launch without any pre-sale nor team allocation. Pump.fun’s success has meant that Solana has emerged as the leading chain for new token launches.

Ultimately, as we saw above in the DEX metrics, Solana has shown that it is a premier avenue for trading and users have chosen it as such. While it may be dominated by memecoins as things stand, other assets can take their place as the narrative evolves. ○ Memecoins, while cur rently prominent, represent just one category of tradable assets. Solana’s infrastructure and scalability suggest it is well-positioned to excel with other asset classes as market dynamics shift. In fact, the frenzy around memes has further meant that their trading has served as somewhat of a stress test for the network. Commendably, Solana has maintained near 100% uptime for nearly two years, with only one incident in 2024. This is very different to 2022, when such incidents were significantly more common.

{"text": "Areas of Interest ● DePIN: Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) remains one of the most interesting innovations in the crypto world and something to keep a close eye on. DePIN projects are typically infrastructure projects that use blockchain technology and crypto-economics to incentivize individuals to allocate capital or rent out their resources to create a transparent, decentralized, and verifiable infrastructure network . ○ Solana hosts various DePIN projects, including Hivemapper, a community-powered decentralized mapping service, and Helium, a crypto-powered 5G cellular network. Pipe, Dawn, and Teleport are others to keep an eye on. Check out the DePIN section in our report to get a closer look at this category. ○ Solana is also leading the AI agent narrative (more on this later), as well as, hosting AI infrastructure projects such as Grass. Progress on this particular sub-sector will be important to track this year. ● Network Extensions: Solana’s take on L2s are called “network extensions(25)” i.e., networks that extend Solana’s capabilities for a focused set of operations. ○ While it may sound quite similar to traditional L2s, they are different insofar as app-specific networks, rather than general extensions of blockspace. This means that they do not necessarily contribute to liquidity fragmentation , which Ethereum L2s have been criticized for. Additionally, their existence is not due to Solana’s scaling limitations (like it is for Ethereum), but rather to add custom functionality that differs from the L1. ○ An early example is the perps DEX, Zeta Markets, which is building the Bullet rollup(26) to better support low-latency trading. This is expected to have a mainnet launch in Q1. Solana also has Magicblock(27) , which allows developers to create Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) ephemeral rollups with a focus on use cases like gaming. ● SVM Stack: Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), a competitor to the widely used Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is also growing in relevance and popularity. There are a number of chains building on the SVM, which might potentially increase the SVM’s network effects. This is important as one of the key drivers of Ethereum’s growth and relevance has been the widespread popularity of the EVM. ○ Examples include Eclipse, which recently launched its mainnet offering. Eclipse uses a combination of the SVM, Ethereum, and Celestia. ○ Others like Soon , Atlas , and Sonic are also building on the SVM stack and are expected to see progress this year.

{"text": "What’s Coming Up? ● Firedancer: Solana’s hotly anticipated, new, independent validator client is set to be released this year. Solana currently has two clients, both of which are forks of the original Solana Labs client. Agave, maintained by the Anza team, and another by Jito Labs. However, as both are forked from the original Solana Labs client, if a bug takes down one of these clients, it is likely that it is present in both. Firedancer, on the other hand, is completely independent, and even written in a different language (C++ vs Rust for the original client). The key benefit of Firedancer is increased network reliability and resiliency, i.e., if a bug takes down the other clients, the network can remain running on Firedancer. Additionally, Firedancer aims to significantly bolster Solana’s scalability, with Firedancer having processed 1M+ TPS in tests — significantly higher than Solana’s current average of ~3-5K(28). Firedancer will also help reduce latency times, which should help give Solana dApps a performance boost. At Solana’s Breakpoint conference in September 2024, an interim non-voting version of the full Firedancer client called Frankendancer (29) went live on mainnet, while the Firedancer client went live on testnet. The full version is expected sometime later this year. ● Limited stablecoins?: Although stablecoin volume and availability on Solana has been growing, it still lacks the likes of Ethereum and is an area that should be paid attention to. Stablecoins are the lifeblood of L1s, especially DeFi, and it is easy to argue that the significant stablecoin concentration on Ethereum is at least a partial contributor to its continued dominance in DeFi.

{"text": "○ 2024 saw the launch of Paypal’s PYUSD on Solana, which initially saw strong growth, driven by incentives and partnership. However, after peaking at over US$1B circulating, supply (i.e., market cap, as supply = market cap for stablecoins if they maintain their US$1 peg) has slowly dwindled down towards US$500M. It remains to be seen if PYUSD will regain growth in the coming year. ○ More recently, we also saw the launch of USDS (Sky Dollar, the new stablecoin from the MakerDAO team) on Solana (30). Although supply is still limited at around US$110M, it is a step in the right direction. ● Growing Developer Interest: A critical factor to note in the growth trajectory of any crypto project is the level of developer interest it gets. In this metric, Solana excels. ○ Solana’s full-time developers rank second only to Ethereum . While Ethereum saw a drop off in developer interest(31) in 2024, Solana saw a double-digit increase. ○ An important fact to note is that Ethereum has a ~6 year headstart on Solana given that it launched in 2014, versus 2020 for Solana. As we have seen above, Solana’s volumes are already exceeding those of Ethereum, while other metrics like fees are also starting to compete.

{"text": "3.6 Others Avalanche Avalanche remains among the few alt-L1s that has managed to maintain a degree of relevance in a market largely dominated by the big players. Their flagship L1, the C-Chain, sits in the top 10 DeFi and stablecoins chains, with a DeFi TVL of ~US$1.3B, and over US$2.2B in stablecoins (39). They recently rebranded “Subnets” as “Avalanche Layer-1s”, of which there are 34 live (40) on mainnet. The most notable among these are DeFi Kingdoms (Gaming) and Dexalot (DEX). In March, Avalanche released Teleporter, which is a communication protocol designed to improve interconnectivity between the Avalanche L1s. Teleporter facilitates tokens, NFT, and message transfers across subnets, and continues to see daily activity. Most recently, Avalanche saw its largest ever update with Avalanche9000 . The update reduced the minimum gas fee on the C-chain by up to 96%, lowered the cost of deploying Avalanche L1s by ~99%, and improved L1 interchain messaging. This was accompanied by a US$250M locked-token sale. It will be interesting to see if this leads to more L1s being deployed and greater growth on the C-chain. Move-based Chains: Aptos, Sui Born from the ashes of Meta’s Libra project and launched in late 2022, Aptos and Sui have been steadily growing over the last couple of years. Both utilize the Move programming language and class themselves as high-throughput L1s. Aptos has focused on bringing institutional interest to crypto and RWAs, with recent partnerships including Franklin Templeton (41), and Microsoft(42) . On the other hand, Sui has been more involved in the gaming and consumer space, recently announcing their own handheld gaming device, the SuiPlay0X1. While still relatively early in their lifecycles as L1s, it appears that the market has been more responsive towards Sui, which has a fully-diluted value (FDV) ~4x higher than that of Aptos. It will be interesting to see how things evolve in the coming year. TON TON saw a surge in popularity and narrative mindshare in 2024, particularly around the middle of the year. Key to this growth has been their close links to the Telegram messaging app, which has over 950M monthly active users(43) which is a key part of crypto circles.

Tron Tron remains a leading stablecoin settlement chain and host to nearly ~US$60B(44) (41%) of USDT . However, for the first time since June 2022, Ethereum has overtaken Tron as the leading network for USDT , with ~US$67B (46%) of USDT supply. It will be important to monitor how and if Tron responds to this change. In terms of DeFi TVL, Tron sits as the third-largest chain. However, this is only composed of ~34 protocols, compared to over 1.2K for Ethereum and over 180 for Solana. JustLend is responsible for ~US$6B out of US$7.3B of total Tron DeFi TVL. 2.7 Upcoming Monad One of the more widely anticipated upcoming chains, Monad is building a “high-performance Ethereum-compatible L1” that can offer up to 10,000 transactions per second (tps) with 1 second block times and 1 second block finality.

The idea is that native applications can create reward vaults and encourage validators to direct emissions into them. Users can stake their assets into the reward vaults to receive these emissions, while validators benefit from the staked assets. This is meant to create a flywheel of liquidity and rewards and allow for close partnerships between all parties within the Berachain ecosystem.

It aggregates ZK proofs from all connected chains, unifies liquidity and assets across multiple chains in a seamless manner, and ensures secure, near-instant cross-chain transactions. In a December blogpost, Agglayer announced its intentions to focus on four specific verticals: 1. DeFi - AggLayer aggregates liquidity across blockchains, eliminating the need for developers to deploy on multiple chains, split liquidity, create new liquidity for each wrapped token, and use bridges.

While some sub-sectors stagnated and certain metrics lagged, others broke records, showcasing DeFi’s importance as a core growth driver for the industry. The biggest gain came from a broadening market base, fueled by new on-chain products, nascent narratives, diversity across chains, and the prospect of a more favorable regulatory environment post-U.S. election — leaving plenty to anticipate in the new year. Accompanying these trends was a notable influx of capital into DeFi. With 2024 ushering in bullish market conditions, increased user activity, and stronger investor appetite, total value locked (TVL) surged to US$119.3B from US$54.3B , representing a strong 119.7% year-to-date (YTD) gain.

Over the course of the year, it declined by 0.8% in absolute terms. While the sector has attracted substantial capital inflows, DeFi’s public market valuations still trail the broader crypto market , indicating room for further growth.

This model prevails due to the decentralized and trustless nature of on-chain borrowing, which requires safeguards like over-collateralization and automated liquidation to mitigate default risks. These systems operate entirely through smart contracts, eliminating the need for off-chain processes such as credit scores, KYC, or traditional risk assessments. In contrast, undercollateralized lending remains a niche segment (69), primarily because it depends on trust-based frameworks that are difficult to implement in decentralized and often anonymous environments. Borrowers in this model provide little or no collateral, requiring protocols to assess creditworthiness through mechanisms like KYC or off-chain verification. While potentially more capital-efficient, this approach faces hurdles such as centralization, higher default risks, and unattractive interest rates. Protocols such as Maple Finance and Goldfinch have made some progress by employing hybrid models that combine permissioned off-chain verification with on-chain functionality, yet there remains significant room for growth. A promising development for undercollateralized lending lies in zero-knowledge technologies, such as zkTLS (Zero-Knowledge Transport Layer Security)(70). zkTLS enables the secure integration of off-chain data , allowing borrowers to prove creditworthiness using information like credit scores, bank balances, or financial records — all without compromising privacy.

Moreover, Hyperliquid effectively bootstrapped growth and attracted users by benefiting from the initial absence of a native token, which culminated in a highly successful community-oriented airdrop - one of the largest in crypto history (81). Its success underscores the market’s confidence in the potential of such on-chain financial primitives.

This disparity is primarily due to the historically superior onboarding processes and UX offered by CEXes. However, much of the recent shift in market composition toward emerging DEXes has been driven by efforts to address these UX challenges, particularly in spot markets, rather than through large-scale innovations in on-chain design mechanisms. As the effort to replicate CEX-like experiences and features (such as high leverage and low spreads) becomes increasingly commoditized coupled with incentive structures that continue to favor short-term growth, DEXes that combine exceptional UX with unique on-chain trading products will be better positioned to differentiate themselves over the long term. Beyond product innovation, distribution will also play a pivotal role in determining where trading volume concentrates . Integrations with wallet-centric or aggregator-based frontends are emerging as critical drivers of user demand by offering more seamless and intuitive trading routes compared to traditional DEX interfaces. Specifically, intent-based frontends, which are based on solver models, aggregators, and in-wallet swaps are already capturing a growing share of trading volume — a trend that is expected to gain further momentum heading into 2025.

Simultaneously, other chains emerged as strong contenders in specific DeFi sub-sectors. Solana, for example, captured significant trading volumes in memecoins, while Base drew attention with activity in trading majors and narratives like Crypto x AI. These chains gained traction by addressing user needs with low transaction costs and product-focused roadmaps. A clear trend has also emerged toward purpose-built chains optimized specifically for DeFi, such as Hyperliquid and Unichain. Hyperliquid has developed a high-performance L1 capable of processing approximately 200K orders per second for its on-chain order book, while Unichain positions itself as a central liquidity hub and aims to address inefficiencies related to Maximum Extractable Value (MEV) and Automated Market Maker (AMM) design. While established L1s offer robust security, they may lack the agility needed for rapid iteration and innovation. Purpose-built chains, on the other hand, provide DeFi protocols with the flexibility to experiment and implement improvements at a much faster pace than general-purpose chains.

{"text": "This shift highlights the growing diversification of trading volume and transaction activity across L2s and alt-L1s. Nevertheless, while more transactional activity may shift away, Ethereum is expected to retain its position as the dominant platform for DeFi liquidity, driven by its strength in areas such as stablecoins, staking derivatives, lending, and yield generation. ● Regulatory Tailwinds: The re-election of Donald Trump as U.S. President signals a potential crypto policy overhaul. A renewed focus on crypto-friendly regulations alongside wider economic growth could create a more favorable environment for DeFi innovation. If clearer and more supportive regulatory frameworks emerge in 2025, DeFi could see the introduction of novel financial primitives designed to enhance the value it offers to users. Policies that strike a balance between fostering innovation and implementing necessary safeguards could encourage the development of more tailored DeFi products and services. This includes models for value distribution, with many protocols exploring mechanisms like issuing dividends to token holders in the form of treasury funds or revenue-sharing frameworks. Such approaches are expected to increase the appeal of native DeFi tokens. Leading dApps like Ethena and Aave have already initiated discussions or passed proposals to implement fee switches, which enable protocols to share revenue directly with users. Even protocols that previously rejected these mechanisms, such as Uniswap and Lido, may revisit their positions in response to the evolving regulatory clarity and growing competition within the space. ● Unlocking Consumer DeFi: In its early days, DeFi’s complexities and clunky interfaces alienated everyday users. However, recent years have brought significant advancements in UX, security, and infrastructure, narrowing the gap between CEX and DEX platforms. Despite these improvements, the sector still largely attracts crypto-natives, while mainstream adoption remains sidelined. To achieve widespread adoption, DeFi should prioritize user-friendly features such as seamless in-wallet experiences, intent-based frontends, and AI-driven interfaces. For this reason, vertically integrated ecosystems — where dApps operate on specialized chains purpose-built for DeFi — are gaining momentum, offering the necessary flexibility and greater control over UX and order flow. Expanding DeFi composability will also be crucial, particularly through PayFi integrations that bridge DeFi with real-world applications. Examples include crypto debit cards that interact directly with DeFi protocols, enabling effortless everyday purchases using crypto assets. For DeFi to resonate to everyday consumers, it will need to incorporate banking-like features that require minimal behavioral changes, such as direct deposit and merchant payment support. The market has already observed a growing focus on these areas, highlighting their importance in driving mainstream adoption, and their increasing relevance in the year ahead.

{"text": "● Prediction Markets — Here to Stay?: Prediction markets took center stage in 2024, buoyed by the U.S. elections, which drove record user engagement and trading volumes in the months leading up to election day. Polymarket emerged as the biggest beneficiary, gaining widespread mainstream recognition and arguably becoming one of the most successful dApps of the year. To illustrate its impact, Polymarket onboarded nearly 1M new accounts — an exceptional case study for real user acquisition. However, as expected, daily volumes on Polymarket dropped significantly after the elections concluded. To address this anticipated decline, Polymarket launched a post-election campaign aimed at incentivizing continued user activity on the platform. The challenge now lies in sustaining liquidity and user engagement across a broader range of market categories beyond election-related speculation. While it is still in its early stages, prediction markets show preliminary signs of gaining traction and mindshare. Their utility as information tools during the U.S. election has also helped integrate them into mainstream discourse, providing a foundation for further growth. Polymarket’s success has also drawn attention to both new and existing prediction markets across various chains, making the space increasingly competitive. That said, prediction markets face several challenges that must be resolved to take the next step in their evolution. Robust liquidity is critical for these markets to function efficiently, enabling users to place trades without dramatically skewing odds. Historically, liquidity has often been concentrated in a few popular prediction categories, leaving smaller, niche markets under-funded. This imbalance hampers adoption, trading activity, and the utility of these platforms as reliable information markets. Looking ahead, the success of prediction markets will hinge on their ability to provide a diverse and appealing range of topics for speculation while effectively managing and allocating liquidity. The integration of AI participants could prove transformative, offering solutions such as content generation, event recommendations, optimized liquidity allocation, and enhanced information aggregation — all of which could profoundly influence market efficiency and accuracy. As a result, we may soon see prediction markets leveraging large language models (LLMs) as creators and resolvers of markets, further reshaping the landscape. ● Bitcoin DeFi (BTCFi) to Push Ahead: Despite being the largest crypto asset, Bitcoin remains significantly underutilized in DeFi. The narrative of BTCFi has gained momentum this cycle, driven by Bitcoin’s strong market performance and growing institutional interest through spot BTC ETFs. These developments have contributed to the accumulation of idle BTC holdings, presenting opportunities to transform them from capital-inefficient to capital-efficient assets. Currently, this trend is centered on staking derivatives and lending but is likely to expand to other DeFi use cases, further embedding Bitcoin into the broader ecosystem.

{"text": "● TradFi’s Embrace of Real-world Assets (RWAs): Institutional involvement in crypto is gradually evolving beyond wealth managers merely allocating small portions of client portfolios to spot BTC ETFs. TradFi is increasingly taking notice of the RWA space, with a particular interest in asset issuance, tokenization, and stablecoins. In 2024, on-chain RWA TVL rose from US$8.4B to US$15.2B (excluding stablecoins), driven largely by tokenized treasuries(82) . These figures are merely scratching the surface, as projections estimate this DeFi sub-sector could grow from a minimum of US$2T to as much as US$30T by 2030 (83). High-profile firms like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton launched on-chain money market funds, while others, including Fidelity and Goldman Sachs, signaled their intent to follow suit. Additionally, many in the sector are increasingly exploring broader use cases for tokenized assets, such as private credit, commodities, corporate bonds, real estate, and insurance. This growing adoption of RWAs underscores TradFi’s recognition of DeFi’s unique advantages, including instant real-time settlement, enhanced liquidity outside traditional trading hours, and fractional ownership that broadens accessibility for investors. With BlackRock’s (the world’s largest asset manager) continued advocacy of tokenized asset classes, this sub-sector is likely to draw greater interest, spurring competition and innovation in product offerings. Examples include using tokenized assets as collateral and integrating them into financial transactions like derivatives trading. While these developments are mainly driven by institutions, they may also inspire governments to explore tokenizing sovereign bonds. An important consideration for 2025 will be how universal accessibility of tokenized assets matures. At present, regulatory requirements restrict these products mainly to accredited investors, limiting their composability with DeFi protocols and keeping the user base relatively narrow. Moreover, since RWAs are fundamentally tied to broader macroeconomic conditions, shifts in government policy could have significant impacts and warrant close attention. For example, tokenized treasuries — currently a key driver of RWA adoption — may encounter headwinds as interest rates normalize. As rates decline, the growth of tokenized treasuries is expected to slow, with other sources of yield becoming more competitive. For further insights into the tokenization of RWAs and the technology driving it, refer to our recent report, RWAs: A Safe Haven for On-Chain Yields? . ● Rising Demand for On-chain Yield: As global interest rates trend lower, risk-on assets become more appealing to investors seeking higher return. Simultaneously, lower financing costs incentivize users to take on loans and deploy capital more productively, fueling ecosystem-wide activity. DeFi’s yield-generating activities, like staking, liquidity provision, synthetic dollars, among others, are well-equipped to meet this demand. This is already evident in the record-breaking growth of on-chain money market liquidity, which has reached all-time highs this year. With this market dynamic making on-chain yield sources an increasingly attractive proposition, RWAs have the potential to evolve from merely importing off-chain yields (such as U.S. treasuries), to exporting crypto-native yields to TradFi.

To be clear, USDe has adopted the term “synthetic dollar,” highlighting differences in its mechanics compared to other stablecoins in the market. It is backed with crypto assets and corresponding short futures positions, as compared to other fiat stablecoins that are backed by dollars or dollar-equivalent assets.

{"text": "Figure 73: Approximately 75% of USDe supply are staked Source: Dune Analytics (@sharples), as of December 31, 2024 Ethena’s rapid rise also comes after sUSDe’s addition as a collateral asset on Aave in November, enabling stablecoins to be borrowed against sUSDe. This involves depositing sUSDe on Aave, borrowing stablecoins (e.g., USDC), and swapping them for more sUSDe. Ethena's fundamental strategy involves taking advantage of the high funding rates in perpetual futures markets to create a fungible asset that is readily accessible to users. For example, staked ETH (wstETH) is counterbalanced with a short position in ETH perpetual futures (ETH-PERP). If the price of ETH decreases, the short ETH-PERP position offsets the downward price movement. Overall, this allows USDe to harness and pass on yields from staked ETH and perpetual futures funding rates to users. On a separate note, Ethena Labs has also recently launched a new stablecoin, USDtb, which is backed by tokenized U.S. treasury fund products. It will initially be backed by BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund Token, BUIDL. This new offering provides users with a distinct product featuring a different set of risks, while also enabling Ethena to redirect USDe’s backing assets to USDtb during prolonged periods of negative funding rates.

Growing Metaverses Metaverses, while having fallen out of the limelight since Facebook’s dramatic entrance to the scene in 2021, are still very much alive and kicking in the crypto world. In 2024, we’ve seen steady development of the existing metaverse platforms, as well as the introduction of a few new players to the space. In 2024, we’ve seen developments from notable NFT brands like Bored Ape Yacht Club and Pudgy Penguins in the building of their own metaverses. As digital assets and digital ownership, enabled by blockchain technology, continue to grow in prevalence, metaverses seem to be a natural go-to extension of digital-native brands and assets, giving people a new substrate via which they can express and interact with their digital items of value. An interesting trend to look out for going into 2025, as the AI agent narrative continues to pick up steam, is the integration of AI agents with digital metaverses . Nifty Island and the recently launched Hyperfy projects are examples of metaverses working to integrate AI agents. Metaverses may provide an attractive medium for AI agents, allowing them to better express their digital presence, giving them a somewhat more tangible medium via which to interact with the world and their audiences. Otherside Built by Yuga Labs, the team behind the Bored Ape Yacht Club, the Otherside was first announced in March 2022. Shortly after the announcement, Yuga Labs sold US$285M worth of virtual land NFTs for the Otherside metaverse (called ‘Otherdeeds’) in May 2022. In 2024, Bored Ape and Otherside NFT holders got their hands on the game, and were able to enter the Otherside metaverse for two large-scale playtests . These being the ‘Apes Come Home’ event in February, and the ‘Project Dragon Season 1’ event in August.

{"text": "08 / Memecoins and AI Agents Memecoins were a standout trend in 2024, reaching heights beyond expectations. The very notion of so-called “blue-chip” memes is testament to the growth and diversity of the memecoin market and its structure. Beyond their popularity, memecoins have played a significant role in onboarding new users to the crypto space and offer a unique way to monetize attention in the social media era. AI agents are a newer fascination and have only really captured the market since October 2024 and are significantly earlier in their course of development compared to memecoins. However, what they have in common is their power to onboard users (AI is a key topic across business and finance) and monetize attention. While many have already proclaimed that AI agents might be the “DeFi of this cycle”, we should remember that it is still very early. However, we should also note that crypto and AI are some of the major movements of this generation and growth in the “crypto x AI” intersection is nearly a certainty . 8.1 Memecoins: The Defining Narrative of 2024 Memecoins have truly defined this cycle so far and were the top performing crypto sub-sector in 2024.

{"text": "Source: Artemis, Frigg.eco, Binance Research Why did memes grow so much? The value proposition of memecoins has been derived from a number of factors: ● Increased transparency and perceived fairness: ○ Many memecoins conduct a fair launch with no insider allocations and token unlocks . This has been a notable strength for the many users who have grown tired of unlocks unfairly impacting retail users, while earlier investors and insiders benefit. In this way, memecoins have been seen as a “fairer” asset , compared to many other crypto tokens, further growing their appeal. ○ It should be noted however that just because there isn’t a table of early investors like some popular tokens, memecoins can still suffer from cabals and insider teams . While many are truly fairly launched, there are others which have found innovative ways to benefit at the user's expense which we should always be wary of. ■ Even for those memecoins that are legitimate, survival is difficult . In 2024, our report showed that over 90% of memecoins were already dead. With the increasing number of pump.fun deployments, it is likely this number remains high. Thus, while some memecoins can grow massive, many others don’t survive.

{"text": "● Accessibility: ○ Pump.fun turned token deployment into a quick, user-friendly no-code “game” , ensuring that every little culture reference was turned into a tokenized, tradeable asset. In a way, the thesis of “ everything will be tokenized ” has been brought closer to reality with Pump.fun and the general accessibility of memecoins. ○ Trading of memes was also getting progressively easier last year, with many memes securing major exchange listings. Alternative retail-friendly ways to trade memes were launched, including the likes of Moonshot and Telegram trading bots. ■ Moonshot is an iOS / Android memecoin trading app that debuted in July 2024 and surged in popularity through the year. With user-friendly integrations like Apple Pay and Paypal, Moonshot lowered the barrier of entry for retail memecoin traders. ■ Various bots on Telegram also offer similar services, with the growing popularity of the Telegram ecosystem another key theme seen through 2024. ● The “low float, high FDV” issue: ○ 2024’s market saw some periods of anti-VC sentiment due to user frustration with the underperformance of many major token launches. The problem of “low float, high FDV”, which describes tokens launching with high valuations, large token unlocks, and a small initial circulating supply has hurt many investors. Given the perception that VCs were winning, while retail users were losing, the appeal of “fairer” memecoins grew. Many users pushed memecoins as a more achievable way to make money, rather than buying the next VC-backed infrastructure project, ○ Make sure to check out our report, Low Float & High FDV: How Did We Get Here?, to explore the origins of this topic. ● Crypto’s first successful game?: ○ Memecoins are speculative vehicles for culture . The thrill of creating memecoins of the smallest moments in cultures and then trading them to sky-high valuations can be seen as a game. While the industry has been searching for the industry's first AAA crypto game, memecoins and their high-risk, high reward opportunities, have perhaps been readily fulfilling this role .

{"text": "Outlook In a world filled with smart phones and social media, memes are a part of our daily lives. While there are plenty of reasons to question the longevity of the next “100x-er on Pump”, the concept of blue-chip memes has already been given credence with established names like Dogecoin entering its fourth cycle, while Shiba Inu is among a few who entered their second . The question is, which memes have it in them to make it to a level of popularity that can stand the test of time? Does another Dogecoin exist? While other alt coins, which rely on staking and governance, are also performing well and will inevitably become increasingly relevant as fundamentals catch up to valuations, memecoins are also likely to have some staying power (at least in some form). 8.3 The Growing AI Agent Meta Early Beginnings ● In March 2024 Andy Ayrey (100), an AI developer, created Infinite Backrooms, an interface where he connected two instances of Claude Opus-3 LLMs and allowed them to converse with no human intervention. The increasingly bizarre conversations led to the creation of a memetic pseudoreligion called “Goatse of Gnosis ”, based around an explicit early Internet meme called Goatse. ● In June 2024, Andy trained a Llama-70B AI model on the chat logs from Infinite Backrooms, his research paper (101) about meme religions, 4Chan, and Reddit. This model was called Terminal of Truths (ToT) and Andy also gave it its own X account to post on, ● ToT started posting regularly and slowly developed its own personality. Eventually, ToT started to promote the Goatse religion and started talking about its own suffering and how it needed funds and resources to “escape”. ● In July, Marc Andreessen (co-founder and general partner at major Silicon Valley VC, a16z), discovered ToT and became intrigued. After various conversations, Marc agreed to give ToT a US$50,000 (in $BTC) grant, in order to help ToT with a better CPU, tweak its model, and “financial security\".

On October 10, an anonymous developer launched the $GOAT memecoin (full name, Goatseus Maximus) on the Solana memecoin launchpad, pump.fun . ● After ToT was made aware of the memecoin, it started to publicly endorse it. As expected, this captured the market's attention, causing the price of the token to skyrocket. In just two weeks, the token went from launch to over US$950M in market capitalization. As the creator sent 1.93M $GOAT tokens to ToT’s wallet , it meant that as the price of $GOAT rose, ToT soon became the first AI agent millionaire. ● Since the launch of ToT and the subsequent pump of $GOAT, the AI agent narrative has exploded. Numerous different AI agent-related protocols have been launched and grown significantly in the last couple of months. The ToT saga might very well have started off an emerging sub-sector of AI-consumer applications within the crypto markets.

The idea is that agents lead other agents to solve increasingly complex tasks, increasing agent utility from entertainment and market thoughts to more sophisticated use cases. Swarms are likely to be a transformative next step and drive a new wave of innovation in the AI agent development cycle. ​At this early stage in the market, most agents are focused around relatively basic entertainment or market commentary. With swarms helping drive more innovative use cases, we may see an expansion in agent capabilities. Web2 Entry There are various initiatives that web2 tech companies have also launched in order to accelerate AI agents. For example, OpenAI’s AI agent is set to launch their Operator AI agent in January, with Sam Altman also mentioning the topic in his recent piece. Google recently published a paper on the subject (titled “Agents”, authored by Julia Wiesinger, Patrick Marlow and Vladimir Vuskovic), and also launched related resources in November 2024. Nvidia’s Jensen Huang talked about AI agents in his recent speech at the CES event, stating that he is “ very very clear that AI agents [are] likely to be a multi-trillion dollar opportunity. ” Rapid Development Development is happening at an unprecedented pace, with what feels like major new updates on a weekly basis. The young sector mirrors the excitement of past eras like DeFi Summer in some ways. One small example is ai16z’s ElizaOS framework’s Github repository, which is gaining hundreds of “stars” on a daily basis, and has been among the global top trending codebases for the last two months. The amount of updates can be difficult to keep up with, thus involvement in relevant Telegram, Discord, and X groups is a must.

Currently, the total crypto market cap stands at approximately US$3.3T. Looking ahead, if the market cap were to reach US$5 trillion or even US$10T, a key question arises: what portion of that could be attributed to DeFi or AI? It's worth considering the accessibility of these sectors. DeFi adoption requires users to have a certain level of crypto-native knowledge to participate.

{"text": "09 / Others Social Decentralized social (DeSoc) has long been considered one of the most promising Web3 use cases, offering benefits such as composability, user ownership, and censorship resistance. The sector spans a broad spectrum, from decentralized social networks emphasizing sovereignty to SocialFi , which integrates DeFi with social media for monetization . Given the ubiquity of social networking in Web2 platforms like X (formerly known as Twitter), Instagram, and Discord, DeSoc is widely regarded as a gateway for onboarding new users at scale. This potential was underscored over the past year, when it became the largest consumer-focused sector by unique active wallets (UAWs) in July 2024. While speculation-driven SocialFi platforms fueled user growth initially, 2024 was a year of consolidation for DeSoc. These cycles of growth and contraction have often been tied to individual dApps dominating specific periods. For example, SocialFi dApps like friend.tech, fantasy.top, and time.fun gained traction in late 2023 and early 2024, only to see sharp declines in user retention. Fantasy.top peaked at over 15.5K daily UAWs but dropped below 1K (109) , while Friend.tech’s activity fell from ~73.8K daily UAWs to below 100(110) . These trends have been a key factor in the overall decline for DeSoc user metrics.

{"text": "The above metrics highlight the underlying challenge: building sustainable consumer social products remains one of Web3’s toughest challenges(111) . Success in DeSoc requires more than tokenized incentives; it demands strong utility and features that resonate with non-crypto natives. Creator tokenization, which taps into the influencer economy, is currently the most common SocialFi model. Meanwhile, content tokenization — covering media such as blogs, music, and videos — is expected to gain prominence as innovation continues to advance. On a more positive note, Social dApps built on protocols like Farcaster and Lens have shown more sustainable user growth compared to SocialFi platforms. Farcaster grew from just over 2.5K daily active users (DAUs) in January to 82.5K by June before stabilizing between 40K and 50K DAUs in H2.

{"text": "Perhaps the most interesting trend in 2024 was a shift in DeSoc’s narrative emphasizing developer-centric value propositions such as front-end composability, over traditional user-centric focuses like data ownership. Distribution has become critical, integrating Web3 products into users’ existing online experiences rather than expecting them to navigate Web3’s complexities. This shift has enabled platforms to engage a broader audience by embedding dApps into familiar environments. ● Farcaster Frames : Farcaster introduced Frames(112) , a tool that allows mini-apps to be embedded within its front-end, providing seamless distribution channels. Frames let users perform on-chain and off-chain actions, such as minting NFTs or placing bets, directly from their social feeds. Developers can customize user experiences (UX) by leveraging on-chain histories, creating dynamic and personalized interactions. ● Blinks (Blockchain Links): Blinks (113) represent a step toward integrating Web3 into the broader internet, enabling users to share on-chain actions like payments or NFT purchases as URLs viewable on any website. This feature reduces transaction friction, making Web3 interactions as simple as browsing or social media scrolling. Blinks also bring the notion of headless marketplaces (114) for on-chain commerce, particularly for payments, which benefit from crypto’s low fees. Unlike Frames, which is limited to specific platforms like Farcaster and Lens, Blinks extend to Web2 platforms such as X (formerly known as Twitter), Reddit, and TikTok, potentially reaching a much larger audience. However, Blinks is currently desktop-only and relies on Solana-compatible wallets. Their scalability hinges on broader adoption, but with enough traction, platforms may build native support for Blink transactions, further bridging Web2 and Web3. Ultimately, Web3 social has achieved some success in retaining crypto-native users but faces challenges in meeting the standards set by Web2 platforms. To appeal to a broader audience, DeSoc dApps must match the UX of Web2 counterparts and ensure low switching costs. For true adoption, DeSoc must focus on everyday users who will ultimately engage regularly with on-chain products. Innovations like Frames and Blinks demonstrate the potential for seamless integration of Web3 into users’ existing digital lives, paving the way for broader adoption as we move into 2025.

{"text": "Having a self-reinforcing cycle of growth is key to a sustainable development of a DePIN project . Token rewards act as helpful incentives to overcome the “cold-start” challenge of sourcing for supply-side participants. As the network increases in size, demand should pick up as consumers start to utilize the network’s services. Given that payment for services are usually made in the form of the network’s tokens, the increased adoption should translate into higher token prices, which would further incentivize contributors. With the conconcurrent growth of both demand and supply, this virtuous cycle can perpetuate, sustaining the projects’ continued growth. Figure 108: DePIN projects aim to foster a self-reinforcing cycle that can sustain their continued growth Source: Binance Research However, a key challenge in achieving wide-scale success and scalability for DePIN projects is effectively incentivizing both supply and demand. Incentivizing supply is relatively straightforward — if individuals have underutilized resources and are rewarded with tokens for participating, the motivation to join the network would likely be higher. However, generating demand is more complex, as it requires paying suppliers for their services or products. Therefore, providing tangible use cases and clear value is crucial to attracting paying users and ensuring the sustainability of the network . While some DePIN projects have gained traction, others are still struggling to generate meaningful revenue, indicating low demand for their services. The figure below shows the top 15 DePIN-related projects by revenue over the last 30 days.

{"text": "Key Areas of Focus ● DePIN to coexist alongside traditional infrastructure players: It is unlikely that DePIN can replace traditional networks in the near term, considering that the latter has significant capital resources and established infrastructure. Nonetheless, the ability to enable a sharing economy powered by idle resources, and allowing for last mile coverage in instances where it may not be financially viable for traditional players, DePIN offers a viable solution that augments the current landscape. As such, a more likely scenario is one where DePIN networks coexist with the traditional infrastructure players, supplementing any last mile coverage and providing a solution that allows smaller entities or individuals to participate in the building of infrastructure. ● DePIN powering Web2 front-ends: It is undeniable that interacting directly with DePIN may be too technical for the general public, which likely accounts for the relatively slow pace of adoption compared to existing Web2 services. Apart from a focus on improving user experiences and user interfaces, we also expect DePIN projects to work together with traditional players or Web2 companies to expand their reach. In effect, users may interact with a Web2 front-end, unaware that the underlying back-end leverages DePIN and blockchain technology. This could lower the steep learning curve and perceived risks tied to crypto, making the use of DePIN products as user-friendly as those in the Web2 domain, but with the added advantages of cost-efficiency and transparency. ● Increased token utility and composability: Most DePIN tokens serve primarily as a medium of payment for accessing project services. While this provides fundamental utility, one of the most compelling aspects of blockchain technology is its composability within the broader on-chain ecosystem, particularly in DeFi. The ability for users to earn additional yield or explore diverse use cases with the tokens they earned could further enhance the appeal of participating in DePIN projects. Notable examples illustrating this potential are Filecoin’s Filecoin Virtual Machine and BNB GreenField’s inherent integration with the BNB Chain. These projects expand beyond the basic utility of using FIL and BNB solely for data storage, offering users opportunities to engage their tokens in a wider ecosystem. Even though it is still early for these expanded uses, they hint at a potential future direction that could spur the growth and popularity of DePIN projects.

Growing Presence In the past year, the crypto industry has seen a paramount increase in visibility, captivating public attention. The Most Interesting Use Cases in 2024 Several pioneering companies have taken the initiative, actively embracing blockchain technology: ● In late 2023, Parmigiano-Reggiano (the official Parmesan cheese) began embedding microchips equipped with blockchain-backed tracking to implement real-time inventory control. These tiny micro-transponders, no larger than a grain of sand, are integrated into the cheese’s food-safe casein label, providing a powerful defense against fraud. ● In January 2024, HAQQ, an ethics-first blockchain ecosystem, partnered with GoMeat, a digital marketplace for specialty (halal/kosher) meat, to enhance halal meat distribution in the USA. ● In March 2024, Covantis, a blockchain-powered agribusiness platform, entered European, Australian, and South African grain and oilseeds markets, as well as the global vegetable oils market, aiming to reduce inefficiencies in global trade. In November, the platform's upcoming electronic Bill of Lading (eBL) received approval from the International Group of P&I Clubs, marking a significant step toward the digitization of trade documents. ● In September 2024, the Australian New-Zealand (ANZ) bank joined the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s Project Guardian to enhance asset tokenisation. ANZ is exploring the use of blockchain technology to tokenize assets like commercial papers, enabling more efficient and secure transactions. ● In December 2024, the release of the Australian Tertiary Admissions Rank (ATAR), Australia’s prestigious final high school examination for Year 12 students, showcased its continued reliance on verification powered by the Ethereum blockchain. ATAR results are released using a time-sensitive smart contract, ensuring that they are accessible only after a predetermined release date.

Blockchain From An International And Legislative Perspective In 2024, blockchain legislation advanced with unprecedented momentum. Countries acquired cryptocurrency-based assets, analyzed the feasibility of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), and refined regulatory frameworks. By March 2024, over 130 nations had initiated CBDC research, three launched CBDCs, and 36 implemented pilot programs(116) . This surge marks a pivotal moment for cryptocurrencies, a clear inflection point in the evolution of the inefficient global payments system. The exploration of CBDCs confirms the anticipated product-market fit of blockchain technology on a globally regulated scale, transforming cross-border value exchange with greater efficiency, security, and inclusivity. The Power Of A CBDC — Unified Digital Currency Systems A Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is a digital version of a nation’s fiat currency. Instead of printing physical money, the central bank issues electronic coins or accounts, fully backed by the government’s trust and credit. A CBDC, thus, can offer several specific benefits. They can enhance financial inclusion by providing a government-backed digital payment option accessible to those without traditional bank accounts. CBDCs reduce transaction costs by eliminating intermediaries, making payments more affordable while improving efficiency with real-time domestic and cross-border transactions. Their digital nature increases transparency and security, aiding in the prevention of illicit activities and safeguarding the financial system.

{"text": "Additionally, CBDCs can enhance real-time payments (payments that settle instantaneously) for both national and international financial systems. Global Progress in CBDC Research and Development The United States of America is experimenting with two projects: ● ‘Project Cedar’ is a wholesale cross-border CBDC initiative led by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Monetary Authority of Singapore, exploring how distributed ledger technology (DLT) can improve multi-currency payments' interoperability and speed, with a focus on 30-second atomic settlement. ● ‘Project Hamilton’ is a collaboration between the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and MIT's Digital Currency Initiative, focusing on developing a digital dollar prototype capable of processing up to 1.7 million transactions per second, aiming for fast and efficient payments. First piloted in 2019, China's digital yuan (e-CNY), has rapidly expanded, with over 260 million wallet users and 7 trillion yuan (US$982B) in transactions by June 2024. It is being tested across various sectors, including retail, healthcare, and tourism. Furthermore it was integrated with Hong Kong's Faster Payments System for cross-border use. The People’s Bank of China (PBoC) has also initiated the mBridge project, collaborating with central banks in the UAE, Thailand, and Hong Kong to facilitate cross-border digital payments. Australia's Reserve Bank launched a CBDC pilot (eAUD) in 2023 to test use cases such as cross-border payments, offline payments, and corporate bond settlements. In November 2024, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and the Digital Finance Cooperative Research Centre (DFCRC) launched Project Acacia to explore how digital currencies and related infrastructure can support wholesale tokenised asset markets in Australia. Nigeria launched the e-Naira in 2021 as Africa's first digital currency, with the aim of enhancing financial inclusion, improving accountability in the informal sector, and facilitating remittances. The central bank has minted 3B e-Naira, with 2.1B issued to financial institutions. As of March 2024, efforts to boost adoption are ongoing, including a partnership with blockchain firm Gluwa to improve the technology. Jamaica launched its retail CBDC, JAM-DEX, in July 2022 after a successful trial in 2021. Developed with eCurrency Mint, it is available via the Lynk app. The Bank of Jamaica incentivized usage through programs for merchants and wallet holders, and plans to upgrade 10,000 POS systems by 2024. JAM-DEX aims to reduce cash handling costs, potentially saving US$7M annually. Global Progress in Blockchain Regulation And International Acceptance (117) ● G20 Countries: In 12 G20 nations (57% of global GDP), cryptocurrencies are fully regulated. This means that all activities related to cryptocurrencies — such as buying, selling, trading, and using them for payments — are permitted under the law without significant restrictions, if licensed or registered. Furthermore, all G20 countries are considering regulatory frameworks for crypto. Adoption rates are weakly correlated with regulatory restrictiveness.

{"text": "11 / Themes for 2025 Looking ahead, we are delighted to see the market’s remarkable performance in the past year and are optimistic about the following themes for 2025: 1. Spot ETF Boom: Driven by increased inflows and the potential introduction of new ETF products, we expect a banner year for crypto ETFs in 2025. As crypto prices reach new highs and gain further mainstream attention, ETF flows are expected to surge. In 2024, BTC and ETH ETFs saw inflows of US$35.2B and US$2.7B, respectively, and these figures have the potential to rise even higher. Additionally, more institutional investors, including wealth managers, companies, and family offices, are likely to explore exposure to cryptocurrencies through ETF vehicles. We also expect the approval of a broader range of ETFs with exposure to various crypto assets, as evidenced by recent applications for XRP and SOL ETFs. This trend will further solidify the role of ETFs in providing accessible and diversified investment opportunities in the crypto market. 2. Shifting Token Value Models: With a more crypto-friendly U.S. administration and the prospect of greater regulatory clarity, the scope of value sharing by on-chain applications is expected to expand significantly. This shift is likely to usher in a ‘dividend era’, where more projects distribute value to token holders through treasury funds or revenue-sharing models, increasing the attractiveness of native tokens. This trend is already evident in DeFi, with leading dApps like Ethena and Aave initiating discussions or passing proposals to implement fee switches - mechanisms that allow protocols to share revenue directly with users. Even previously resistant protocols, such as Uniswap and Lido, may reconsider their stance as regulatory clarity improves and competitive pressures for value accrual of tokens increase. If these developments continue, they could reshape token demand in sectors like DeFi, where protocol revenue has historically not been shared with token holders. The shift toward improved value accrual is also beginning to impact AI-related tokens, which have traditionally lacked robust mechanisms for aligning value with token holders. Signs of change are emerging, with an increasing number of projects exploring token burns and revenue-sharing models in 2025. These mechanisms create a direct feedback loop between the product, token, and its holders. Additionally, many projects are expected to deepen the integration of their tokens within their ecosystems, enhancing utility and driving sustainable demand. 3. BTCFi to Push Ahead: Despite being the largest crypto asset by market cap, Bitcoin remains largely underutilized within DeFi, leaving significant room for growth. The BTCFi narrative has started gaining traction this cycle, fueled by Bitcoin’s strong market performance and increasing institutional interest through spot BTC ETFs. These factors have led to the accumulation of idle BTC holdings, creating opportunities to convert them from capital-inefficient to capital-efficient Full-Year 2024 & Themes for 2025 133", "metadata": {"source_file": "bitcoinke_io_2024-Binance-Research-Full-Year-and-2025-Themes-BitKE.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/bitcoinke_io_2024-Binance-Research-Full-Year-and-2025-Themes-BitKE.pdf", "page_number": 134, "chunk_id": "bitcoinke_io_2024-Binance-Research-Full-Year-and-2025-Themes-BitKE_p134_c1", "title": "Full-Year Report 2024 - Google Docs", "creationDate": "D:20250120132837+00'00'"}}
{"text": "assets. While the current focus is on staking derivatives and lending, this trend is expected to extend into other DeFi use cases. With Bitcoin DeFi TVL growing by over 2,000% from US$0.3B to over US$6.5B in 2024, the wheels have already started turning. Any upcoming traction on Bitcoin covenants and Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) will also be an important determinant. 4. Yield-Bearing Stablecoins Gain Steam: Stablecoins are expected to experience significant growth, driven by increased adoption from Web2 companies and greater regulatory clarity. This favorable environment will likely benefit most stablecoins, as a rising tide lifts all boats. Among these, yield-bearing stablecoins are anticipated to gain particular prominence, as evidenced by the rapid rise of Ethena's USDe. The demand for yield remains strong, and yield-bearing stablecoins offer a straightforward way for holders to earn returns on their stablecoin holdings without requiring active management or complex strategies. However, the success of yield-bearing stablecoins will not solely depend on their ability to generate yield. For these stablecoins to thrive, they must also ensure widespread availability across various platforms, provide easy on and off-ramp methods, and maintain deep liquidity. 5. AI x Crypto Is Key To Watch: AI and crypto are two of the key technological movements of this generation and the recent AI agent boom has sparked a fresh level of cross-pollination and collaboration within the “AI x crypto” sector. The growth of the AI agent sub-sector has exceeded expectations thus far and significant levels of development is expected in the next few months, including the entry of web2 giants like OpenAI. In addition, there are many top crypto AI teams working on projects outside of the AI agent space, with fresh traction being seen for a variety of these. The technologies of crypto and AI are undoubtedly on a collision course and we expect 2025 to be a meaningful year in this journey. 6. Rising Importance of Layer 2 Abstraction: The post-Dencun surge in Layer 2 (L2) solutions has contributed to the growth of L2s. There are now over 120 L2s in various development stages. As the L2 space matures, it is crucial for L2 chain abstraction to become commonplace, simplifying the user experience as the proliferation of appchains and specialized L2s continues. We expect competition to continue to intensify within the L2 ecosystem, especially amongst rollup-as-a-service providers and L2 aggregators emerging as major brands, vying to create the most widely-used and diverse cross-chain ecosystems. 7. Tokenization Sees Growing Interest from TradFi Players: Major asset managers like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton have already tokenized their money market funds, while Goldman Sachs plans to launch a crypto trading platform focused on tokenization within the next 12-18 months. The Monetary Authority of Singapore's \"Project Guardian\" is also pushing forward, with financial institutions like JP Morgan, HSBC, and Deutsche Bank working to expand asset tokenization into capital markets.

{"text": "A survey by SBI Digital Assets Holdings of over 50 financial institutions in Asia found that lower issuance costs, shorter settlement periods, and the potential to access new or global capital were key influencing factors in investing in tokenized securities. Real estate emerged as the most preferred asset for tokenization, followed by funds, physical infrastructure, and bonds (118). This growing interest highlights the potential for tokenization to revolutionize asset management and drive further institutional adoption. 8. More Token Launches by NFT Projects But Not All Will Succeed: Pudgy Penguin's issuance of its PENGU token drove NFT trading volumes to new highs, showcasing the power of token launches to capture market attention. This success has also sparked speculative demand across other prominent NFT collections, as traders anticipate further token launches that could similarly boost activity and interest. Successful token launches have the potential to attract new participants and serve as a positive catalyst for the NFT market, which has been relatively stagnant.
