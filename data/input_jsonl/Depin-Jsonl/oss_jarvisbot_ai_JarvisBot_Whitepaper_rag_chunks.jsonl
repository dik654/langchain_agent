{"text": "JarvisBot Whitepaper 2024v1.0 bots provide instant, personalized responses 24/7, enhancing engagement in areas such as customer support and lead generation [17]. Users can easily clone and customize these bots for use in multiple scenarios to meet their specific needs in various fields such as tools, art, lifestyle, learning, and music [18] This means that the use of AI will be more convenient, open, and democratic [19]. In addition, in terms of details, JarvisBot also provides a comprehensive knowledge base system that allows users to integrate external data, such as local files or real- time online information [20]. This enables AI bots to generate accurate and relevant responses using advanced vector search technology [21]. By empowering users to upload and manage their own data, JarvisBot enhances the customer experience, allows queries to be resolved independently, and optimizes operational efficiency, freeing up valuable support resources [22][23]. Not only that, the emergence of GPT-4o (the \"o\" stands for \"omni\") and Sora has taken human-computer interaction to new heights [24]. These models accept any combination of text, audio, images, and video as input and generate equally diverse outputs [25]. Sora, in particular, can create detailed scenes with multiple characters, actions, and backgrounds, understanding not only what is being asked for, but also how these elements exist in the physical world [26]. This technological leap enables JarvisBot's advanced workflow modules to automate complex tasks [27]. For example, users can enter their requirements and the system will automatically generate high-quality articles, generate cover images, and publish content to platforms such as websites, Telegram, and other third-party applications [28]. This innovation will have a significant impact on content creators, researchers, designers, and social media managers by providing an automated solution for generating and distributing high-quality content [29][30]. For individuals such as bloggers, marketers, and small business owners, JarvisBot's workflow automation will simplify research, content production, visual design, and publishing [31]. This will save time and increase productivity, allowing users to focus on strategy and creativity while AI handles repetitive tasks such as content scheduling and visual generation [32]. 2", "metadata": {"source_file": "oss_jarvisbot_ai_JarvisBot_Whitepaper.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/oss_jarvisbot_ai_JarvisBot_Whitepaper.pdf", "page_number": 4, "chunk_id": "oss_jarvisbot_ai_JarvisBot_Whitepaper_p4_c1", "title": "JarvisBot Whitepaper.pdf", "author": "Ma Ke", "creationDate": "D:20241023073732+00'00'"}}
{"text": "JarvisBot Whitepaper 2024v1.0 We know that more complex and large models require more high-perfomance hardware computing power (GPU/NPU) support, So we will develop the Computing Power Marketplace [33]. The Computing Power Marketplace is designed to revolutionize the accessibility and scalability of AI by creating a decentralized infrastructure for GPU and NPU resources [34]. This marketplace empowers developers, researchers, enterprises, and everyday users to tap into a global network of distributed computational resources, thus eliminating the reliance on centralized providers and reducing barriers for AI innovation [35]. This will effectively communicate computing power providers (nodes), the JarvisBot economic model, and our users [36]. In addition, we have more prospects for the computing power market, introducing AI-driven solutions for cloud gaming, AR/VR, and real-time rendering applications [37]. JarvisBot's computing market positions itself as a decentralized center for GPU/NPU resources, redefining the way AI is developed, deployed, and scaled, and providing more inclusive and cost-effective solutions for the AI industry [38]. By decentralizing AI resources, JarvisBot not only breaks the monopoly of a few powerful entities, but also offsets the impact of AI and GPU bans imposed by various countries [39][40]. This creates an open and inclusive ecosystem that promotes innovation and encourages broad participation [41].

By doing so, they can propose and vote on important issues like upgrades to AI models, new features, or changes to the incentive structure. For instance, if a community member proposes to increase the computational power allocated to specific AI tasks, stakers can vote to either accept or reject that proposal. Model Updates: Governance token holders can influence updates to JarvisBot's AI models. For example, if there’s a proposal to optimize a natural language processing (NLP) model for a specific use case like real-time translation, the community can vote on whether resources should be allocated for that improvement. Stakers can prioritize updates that benefit the entire network or specific industries.
