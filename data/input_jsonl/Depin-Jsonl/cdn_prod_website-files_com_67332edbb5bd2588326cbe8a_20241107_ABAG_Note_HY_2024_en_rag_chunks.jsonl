{"text": "Advanced Blockchain AG Research Report (Note) More transparent reporting planned Under the leadership of the new executive board, consisting of Hatem Elsayed (COO) and Maik Laske (future CFO), the company is undergoing an exciting strategic realignment focused on transparency, sustainable growth, and long-term trust. As part of a compre- hensive restructuring, Advanced Blockchain is currently intensively reviewing its financial and governance processes to establish a solid and reliable foundation for the years ahead. The goal is to present consolidated group financial statements based on audited figures from previous years, thereby strengthening trust among investors and stakeholders. Although a complete group half-year financial statement for 2024 cannot be provided at the annual general meeting on December 4, 2024, due to ongoing audits of the 2021– 2023 fiscal years, the company has already made clear progress towards more transpar- ent and robust financial reporting. By 2025, the strategic direction will be further strength- ened to establish the company as a leading player and trusted “go-to partner” in the cryp- tocurrency and blockchain technology sectors. This includes increased participation in in- vestor and industry conferences, as well as a targeted communication strategy to expand market presence and attract new investors. A central focus for the management is to create a reliable foundation for future financial reports. The company plans to present a complete and audited annual report for 2024 by the first half of 2025, based on adjusted and verified figures from the 2021–2023 periods. These actions represent a critical step towards higher compliance and governance stand- ards and are an essential component of the new strategic direction. The comprehensive review of financial statements will ensure that future reports meet the highest standards of transparency and accuracy. Advanced Blockchain AG plans to strengthen its portfolio management by sharpening its strategic focus and expanding its existing network to make promising early-stage invest- ments in innovative cryptocurrency and blockchain projects. In addition to capital, the com- pany will provide its portfolio companies with strategic advice and access to a comprehen- sive network of experts to maximize their success potential. These investments are aimed not only at creating long-term growth potential and sustainable value but also at further establishing the company as a pioneer in supporting new blockchain initiatives. Through this approach, Advanced Blockchain AG opens up access to Web3 and block- chain investments for all, offering innovative, forward-thinking investment opportunities in the next generation of digital technologies. To further strengthen its positioning, Advanced Blockchain AG plans to sustainably in- crease its visibility with investors and stakeholders through continued participation in rele- vant investor and industry events and a clear, transparent communication strategy. This should help solidify trust in the company and enhance its attractiveness for future invest- ments.

{"text": "Advanced Blockchain AG Research Report (Note) However, since the majority of the investments and holdings are within the Cypriot sub- sidiary Incredulous Labs Ltd., the individual financial statement of the AG is only partially reflective of the entire corporate group, as it represents only a small portion of the group's overall operations. In the first half of 2024, Advanced Blockchain AG (individual company) recorded a mod- erate increase in revenue, rising from €0.046 million in the same period last year to €0.245 million. This increase was mainly driven by the successful sale of Tracebloc shares. How- ever, overall revenue remains relatively low. Operating expenses increased during the reporting period by €0.192 million, totaling €0.309 million (previous year: €0.116 million). This increase in costs was driven by several factors. Some expenses stemmed from decisions made by the previous management. Additionally, costs were incurred due to legally required disclosures. A significant part of the higher expenses was related to the intensive preparation for the consolidation of finan- cials and the ongoing audits of the consolidated financial statements. This includes ex- penditures for preparing and auditing annual reports, as well as legal and tax advisory costs arising from the ongoing restructuring and revisions of governance structures. Fur- thermore, funds were allocated to the further development and optimization of internal processes to enhance the company's efficiency and compliance. The increased operating expenses, combined with the modest revenue, resulted in a slightly negative EBIT and EBITDA. The EBITDA improved slightly compared to the pre- vious year, reducing from -€0.157 million to -€0.119 million, though it remains negative. Similarly, EBIT remained negative but showed a slight improvement, rising from -€0.166 million in the first half of 2023 to -€0.155 million in 2024. The net result for the reporting period showed a modest improvement, decreasing from -€0.166 million to -€0.155 million.

The equity ratio stands at 65.1% (June 30, 2023: 66.3%), maintaining a high level. The liquid assets of Advanced Blockchain AG have significantly increased to €1.62 million (June 30, 2023: €0.09 million). This increase reflects the success of the essential projects initiated by the supervisory board elected at the annual general meeting in August 2023. The rise is primarily due to the successful disposal of assets, particularly the sale of Trace- bloc shares. This positive development has significantly strengthened the company's li- quidity position, enhancing its flexibility for future investments and operational activities. Given this strengthened liquidity and the continued high equity ratio, Advanced Blockchain AG is, in our view, currently in a very solid financial position and well-positioned to pursue its strategic goals in the coming years. The net financial assets, as determined by us, include receivables from affiliated compa- nies amounting to €10.94 million (June 30, 2023: €12.40 million), primarily consisting of loans to Incredulous Labs. We anticipate that these loans can be quickly serviced, as In- credulous Labs holds substantial token investments that far exceed the loan amount and 2", "metadata": {"source_file": "cdn_prod_website-files_com_67332edbb5bd2588326cbe8a_20241107_ABAG_Note_HY_2024_en.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/cdn_prod_website-files_com_67332edbb5bd2588326cbe8a_20241107_ABAG_Note_HY_2024_en.pdf", "page_number": 3, "chunk_id": "cdn_prod_website-files_com_67332edbb5bd2588326cbe8a_20241107_ABAG_Note_HY_2024_en_p3_c1", "author": "Cosmin Filker", "creationDate": "D:20241111144334+01'00'"}}

{"text": "Advanced Blockchain AG Research Report (Note) Valuation Advanced Blockchain AG has published the valuation of its top 15 token portfolio holdings as of June 30, 2024, with a total value of approximately $30 million. This updated valuation corrects a previous, inaccurate estimate of €57.5 million as of December 31, 2023, where an individual holding was erroneously reported at too high a value. Currently, the supervi- sory board is reviewing potential legal actions against the former sole board member and other individuals due to alleged violations such as breach of confidentiality and embezzle- ment of company funds, which were uncovered during investigations into 2023 and the first half of 2024. Our previous valuation was based on the aforementioned €57.5 million, as well as data provided by the former board. As part of the company’s strategic realignment, we are now adopting a more conservative valuation approach. For this, we rely solely on the recently updated valuation of the 15 key portfolio positions, with a deduction for holding costs. As a result, we are currently using a value of $30 million (equivalent to €27.87 million, based on an exchange rate of 1 USD = 0.928971 € as of November 7, 2024, 10:24 UTC). The top investments, peaq and Composable, together account for more than 50% of the portfolio’s value, while Contango, with a growth of 115% since the end of 2023, also rep- resents a significant position. Other notable positions include Panoptic and Polymer, which also represent high-value holdings within the portfolio. The distribution of the total value shows the following focal points: Portfolio item Share of total portfolio Composable (PICA/MANTIS) 24 - 29% Peaq (PEAQ/KREST) 22 - 27% Contango 10 - 15% Panoptic 7 - 12% Polymer 6 - 11% Light Protocol 4 - 9% Permanent Ventures 3 - 8% Delv (formerly Element Finance) 3 - 8% Neon EVM 2 - 7% Talisman 2 - 7% zCloak 2 - 7% Pendulum 1 - 6% Laconic 1 - 6% (based on nominal value) Mero/TLX 0 - 5% Celestia 0 - 5% The current valuation does not include the equity stake in EoT Labs, intellectual property from FinPro, or additional token and software assets held by the group. In recent years, the portfolio valuation has been variable and focused on the top 10 positions. The expan- sion to the top 15 now provides increased transparency and more consistent reporting. A potential valuation catalyst for the Advanced Blockchain AG portfolio is the planned launch of the PEAQ token on November 12. Peaq is a Layer-1 blockchain project that supports decentralized networks for physical infrastructure (DePIN). The new token aims to expand the \"Peaqosystem\" and make the network accessible to over 50 projects. The PEAQ token will enable more efficient interaction between humans and machines, facili- tate transactions, and help manage the network.

{"text": "Advanced Blockchain AG Research Report (Note) Forecast model In accordance with the provisions of §21 (1c) AGB of Deutsche Börse AG for the Open Market at the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the inclusion of a (updated) forecast model is required for a research update. However, our analysts have determined that such a fore- cast model is not suitable for investment companies like Advanced Blockchain AG, which operates in the cryptocurrency sector. As we utilize the GBC NAV valuation approach to assess the company, we do not consider it appropriate to use a forecast model for revenue and earnings figures. Instead, we focus on estimating the value of investments. We believe that a forecast model for investment companies such as Advanced Blockchain AG does not provide meaningful or useful insights for investors. The potential revenues and results in this industry are highly volatile, and we believe that the valuation of an in- vestment company should primarily be based on the valuation of its investments and pro- jects. To comply with the legal requirements of §21 (1c) AGB, we have included this forecast in the research report. However, we would like to emphasize that, in our opinion, the forecast model is supplementary.

This is due to the inherent volatility of Advanced Blockchain as an investment company operating in a young and highly volatile market environment, specifically the cryptocurrency sector. Therefore, we believe that re- lying solely on the forecasts mentioned above to value the company would not be sensible or appropriate. Doing so could lead to an inaccurate valuation of the company. Instead, we recommend focusing on the valuation of the investments held by Advanced Blockchain AG and their potential value. This approach is more suitable and aligns with the unique characteristics of the company and the industry in which it operates.
