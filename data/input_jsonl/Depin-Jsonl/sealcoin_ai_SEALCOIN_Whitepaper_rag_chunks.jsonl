While these functionalities are not guaranteed, their exploration would aim to strike a balance between user autonomy and necessary safeguards to protect the platform and ensure compliance. Restriction Mechanisms • KYC Key: Only accounts that have been explicitly authorized can be linked to the SEALCOIN token. If KYC verification for an account is revoked, all tokens in that account will be automatically frozen. This ensures that only compliant accounts are active within the ecosystem, preventing unauthorized or fraudulent actors from transacting. • Freeze Key: This function allows SEALCOIN Admin to freeze transfers of tokens for a specific account. The Freeze Key must sign any transaction that involves freezing the token, effectively pausing the ability of the account to transfer or transact with SEALCOIN tokens. • Wipe Key: A more comprehensive action than freezing, the Wipe Key allows SEALCOIN Admin to completely empty an account. This functionality might be used in extreme cases of misuse or violation of platform regulations, ensuring that any tokens held by the account are returned to the platform for security or compliance reasons. • Pause Key: This function puts the entire token on pause, halting all operations related to the token across the platform. No transactions or operations can take place while the token is paused, giving SEALCOIN Admin the ability to prevent any activity in cases of platform-wide concerns or threats to security. The restriction mechanisms outlined in this section are designed to provide a balanced approach to security, compliance, and user autonomy within the SEALCOIN platform.

{"text": "SEALCOIN -Whitepaper model to ensure operational efficiency, regulatory compliance, and strategic oversight. This centralized control is essential at the outset to navigate complex regulatory landscapes, establish partnerships, and guide the development of the SEALCOIN platform. By maintaining control during this early phase, SEALCOIN AG can effectively mitigate risks, maintain legal accountability, and ensure that the project’s foundational infrastructure is built securely and efficiently. 8.2 Governance phases However, as the project matures and the platform stabilizes, the governance structure will progressively transition towards a more decentralized model. This shift aligns with SEALCOIN platform long-term vision of decentralization, empowering the community and token holders to take on greater governance roles. This phased approach ensures that the platform remains compliant and secure in its early stages, while gradually opening up decision-making to the community as the ecosystem grows. 8.2.1 Initial Setup The initial phase introduces a centralized governance model, potentially incorporating traditional organizational structures: • Board of Directors: SEALCOIN AG may be led by a board responsible for strategy, financial oversight, and compliance. Directors could be appointed by key shareholders and early investors to ensure operational efficiency. • Executive Management: Day-to-day operations will likely be managed by an executive team (CEO, CTO, etc.), overseeing platform development, token issuance, and more. • Regulatory Compliance: SEALCOIN AG can ensure compliance with regulatory requirements (especially for KYC/AML processes) and filing necessary applications, such as requesting a non-action letter from FINMA and pursuing a Self- Regulated Organization (SRO) application, as per the Swiss Regulator’s guidelines. 8.2.2 Community Integration The second phase gradually involves the community in the platform’s governance, though the exact implementation may vary: • Advisory Council: An advisory body, possibly comprising early adopters, industry experts, and partners, could provide guidance on technical development and partnerships.

{"text": "SEALCOIN -Whitepaper • Token Holder Voting: SEALCOIN TIOT token holders might gain limited voting rights on non-critical decisions, allowing the community to start influencing the platform. • Governance Proposals: A proposal system may be introduced, where users can suggest platform improvements for community review and voting. 8.2.3 Community Governance The third phase envisions further increasing the platform’s decentralization, though implementation details may evolve: • DAO Transition: SEALCOIN AG may transition to a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), granting token holders full governance rights, including decisions on upgrades and fund allocation. Some authority from SEALCOIN AG may shift to community governance. • Staking for Governance: Governance participation could require staking SEALCOIN tokens, incentivizing committed, long-term users to take part in decision- making. • Gradual Exit of Centralized Control: Over time, SEALCOIN AG may reduce its governance role, potentially evolving into a service provider, ensuring security and compliance. 8.2.4 Full Decentralization This ultimate phase crystalizes the retrieval of SEALCOIN AG from controlling bodies of the ecosystem. • Full Community Control: In the final phase, SEALCOIN AG may operate as an independent entity focused on development and regulatory matters, while the SEALCOIN ecosystem and platform governance would be fully controlled by the token holders through the DAO. • Immutable Governance: Key decisions, including token supply management, protocol upgrades, and major ecosystem changes, may be made through community voting mechanisms, ensuring the project is decentralized and operates transparently.
