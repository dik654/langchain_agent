{"text": "1 PREAMBLE This document provides the challenges, expected outcomes, and technical details that should be addressed when preparing applications for TrustChain Open Call #5. The guide is complemented by the Open Call #5 Annexes available at https://trustchain.ngi.eu/. Proposed solutions should build on top of existing concepts and technologies already developed for achieving conformance of data, schemas, state transfer and other aspects of interoperability across multiple, heterogeneous wallets, applications, databases and knowledge bases, tokenization methods, blockchains, and fit within TrustChain’s vision and objectives. For example, they should cover aspects of the digital identity, either based on the DID standard, the eIDAS2 or any other approaches available, privacy and security, ability to generate various proofs that can be generated and provided for verification in various circumstances and similar. The solutions should be provided as open-source software desirably at TRL 7, tested, evaluated, and validated by an adequate pool of potential end-users that should be identified and their needs addressed in the application, as well as supported by a self-sustaining business model for exploiting the developed system following the end of the project. Each proposed solution will have to use the latest technologies for full-stack development that are compatible with the current standards. The call is open for submission from 11 November 2024 to 15 January 2025 at 17:00 CET. 2 THE TRUSTCHAIN PROJECT The Internet has pushed our existence into the digital era, revolutionising our health, our wellbeing, our social life, our education, and our information. Today we approach the Internet with our digital identities. There is a plethora of such digital identities that currently do not properly serve their purpose. Multiple threats related to truthfulness, trust, and identity (ID) arise when people interact in the digital world: delusion and manipulation, personal privacy violation and personal data exploitation, unknown provenance of information, anonymity for performing criminal activities, spread of fake news using fake identities, skills mismatches, serious breaches of security are only a few of the threats that have emerged. The spirit of the first-generation Internet based on individual freedom, material progress, and moral community is slowly turning into individualism, materialism, and moralism, diverging from essential ethical and democratic principles that should underline this technology. The design choice of the past, based on a mix of centrally managed networking and device technologies makes today’s Internet obsolete when it comes to empowering all citizens to act for a more environmentally friendlier digital transformation, as well as to create a more resilient, 4", "metadata": {"source_file": "trustchain_ngi_eu_Open-Call-5_Open-Call-Document-1.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/trustchain_ngi_eu_Open-Call-5_Open-Call-Document-1.pdf", "page_number": 5, "chunk_id": "trustchain_ngi_eu_Open-Call-5_Open-Call-Document-1_p5_c1", "author": "Alexandre Relvão", "creationDate": "D:20241108124749+00'00'"}}

For TrustChain, the current emergence of Internet of Things (IoT), Decentralised Oracles, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Cloud-to-Edge (aka Fog) Computing, Distributed Ledger (DLT) and Digital Twin (DT) technologies created the need to build democratic systems without central points of control that can establish the missing link between universally agreed objectives in the physical world, and the digital representation of the reality, thus contributing to the realisation of trusted relationships in the Next Generation Internet. This can be achieved by using various consensus mechanisms that associate proofs with digital representations and thus help humans understand the objective truth, achieve trusted relationships on the digital world, allowing them to undertake well-informed decisions, in either a manual or automated manner. The ability to arrive at the objective truth by employing democratic governance mechanisms, consensus-based proofs, verification, and certification can lead to a Next Generation Trusted Internet supporting humanity in all aspects of life. Today more than ever, challenges faced all over the world push for our society to reorganise itself to survive. The United Nations have called to reach 17 Sustainable Development Goals. Essentially, TrustChain must be leveraged to embed in the Next Generation Internet principles of human-rights, sustainability, ethics, and other human values that have been developed and maintained through long lasting centuries of human evolution. The key concept of TrustChain is to embed the key humanity principles in the co- creation of the Next Generation Internet and to provide autopoietic, evolutionary, decentralised, and therefore democratic, transparent, traceable, and regulatory compliant mechanisms that can support any ecosystem of entities and actors participating with their digital identities. The basis for this to happen is the use of decentralised digital identity architectures together with IoT, AI, Cloud-to-Edge, DLT and DT. Our intention is to embed in such solution's important societal goals in accordance with objective truth and therefore, trustworthiness. TrustChain - Fostering a Human-Centred, Trustworthy and Sustainable Internet is a European project funded by the European Commission under the European Union’s Horizon Europe Research and Innovation Programme and the call topic CL4-2022- HUMAN-01-03. As such, it is part of the European Commission’s Next Generation Internet (NGI) initiative. Its overall objective is to create a portfolio of Next Generation Internet protocols and an ecosystem of decentralised identity management software solutions that is transparent to the user, interoperable, privacy aware and regulatory compliant that can seamlessly integrate and interoperate with any of the existing decentralised applications. TrustChain was launched in January 2023 to address the inherent challenges within the current centralised Internet architecture that is not transparent to the user, does not protect the privacy-by-default and does not scale well through 5 Open Calls and an overall budget of 8,775 M€. 5", "metadata": {"source_file": "trustchain_ngi_eu_Open-Call-5_Open-Call-Document-1.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/trustchain_ngi_eu_Open-Call-5_Open-Call-Document-1.pdf", "page_number": 6, "chunk_id": "trustchain_ngi_eu_Open-Call-5_Open-Call-Document-1_p6_c1", "author": "Alexandre Relvão", "creationDate": "D:20241108124749+00'00'"}}

CHALLENGES TO BE ADDRESSED Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs), such as blockchain, have been transformative in enabling secure, decentralized systems, but their widespread adoption has led to significant environmental concerns. High electricity consumption, driven by resource- intensive consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work (PoW), the need for widespread transaction verification, and the large amounts of data exchanged across the network contribute to their negative environmental impact. Efforts to reduce this impact must navigate a delicate balance between maintaining decentralization and security while improving energy efficiency. The objective is to optimize DLTs by leveraging digital identities, trustworthy data, and novel economic mechanisms while balancing technological advancement with sustainability.

OC5 SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS Technical Requirements In general, a user centric design and implementation, a co-created process with citizens as well as a use case driven approach will frame the proposed innovative solution development that should carefully consider the needs for security, privacy, human-rights, sustainability, and trustworthiness. Interoperability, scalability, greenness, openness, standards, as well as legal and regulatory compliance should also be considered, calculated, and assured. The proposed solutions are intended to be co-created with end users focusing on online user privacy and data governance, adopting a user-friendly design. Therefore, they should be designed, implemented, piloted, and validated using a specific predefined and justified set of end users in an identified use case. The co-creation and validation approach should be clearly elaborated in the applicants’ proposal. A citizen digital vulnerable collectives’ approach that puts in the centre the needs of the general population and vulnerable people, instead of technical/experts' users should be considered. It is intended that the solution is accessible for the general population as well as for the marginalized/vulnerable communities. To this end, the applicant should show collaboration with an EU end-user organisation (i.e., banking, healthcare, education, policing etc.) as well as consider vulnerable groups for the evaluation /validation process if possible. The focus should be on what is currently missing (e.g., trustworthy data access, ensuring clear and informed user content and expanding what already exists, thus scaling) rather than building something new from scratch. It is desirable that the selected projects be able to demonstrate their solution at TRL 7 in a real end-user setting. If something completely new must be built (see point above), then it should be well motivated why the nature of the problem warrants a new solution and why the state-of-the-art solutions do not solve it today (i.e., barriers to technology adoption). The proposed solution should work within a specific business context and emphasis should be put on its scalability, on its energy efficiency and its minimum value proposition. Cross-border data sharing, moving data across EU-international borders should be carefully considered. It should be also compatible with existing data sharing 15", "metadata": {"source_file": "trustchain_ngi_eu_Open-Call-5_Open-Call-Document-1.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/trustchain_ngi_eu_Open-Call-5_Open-Call-Document-1.pdf", "page_number": 16, "chunk_id": "trustchain_ngi_eu_Open-Call-5_Open-Call-Document-1_p16_c1", "author": "Alexandre Relvão", "creationDate": "D:20241108124749+00'00'"}}

Following that, a roadmap that ranges from the beginning to the end of the project with the appropriate methodologies should be set up. For the approach to be complete it should include a needs assessment of the target end-users, co-creation phases and a final validation.

This tool would allow developers to partition a DLT into smaller groups (shards), enabling efficient data management and lower energy consumption while ensuring cross-shard communication and security. o Consensus-less DLT (API or SDK): This API or SDK would enable the implementation of consensus-less DLT systems, where miners or nodes do not need to communicate to validate transactions. It could offer new models of transaction verification that are less energy intensive. o Secure Data Removal (API or SDK): This would provide mechanisms for secure, verifiable data pruning in a DLT system. It would allow developers to safely delete obsolete data while maintaining the integrity and auditability of the blockchain. o Energy-Efficient Consensus (API or SDK): An API/SDK that integrates energy- efficient consensus algorithms (such as Proof of Stake or Delegated Proof of Stake) and alternative trust models to reduce the environmental impact of DLTs. This would enable developers to choose the most suitable consensus mechanism based on energy consumption needs. o Digital Identity & Trust Management (API or SDK): A digital identity management SDK to facilitate the creation, verification, and management of digital identities 17", "metadata": {"source_file": "trustchain_ngi_eu_Open-Call-5_Open-Call-Document-1.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/trustchain_ngi_eu_Open-Call-5_Open-Call-Document-1.pdf", "page_number": 18, "chunk_id": "trustchain_ngi_eu_Open-Call-5_Open-Call-Document-1_p18_c1", "author": "Alexandre Relvão", "creationDate": "D:20241108124749+00'00'"}}

This API/SDK would support real- time energy consumption analytics and suggest optimizations based on the system’s configuration. o Smart Oracle Framework (API or SDK): Energy efficient smart oracle framework that is based on different trust methods, such as game theory, reputation, and staking. The framework should be able to support different data sources, data types, and data flow direction such as recording data from external sources to smart contracts and triggering events that involve off-chain entities or external APIs. o Cross-chain bridging framework (API or SDK): Robust bridging framework that supports state/data/asset exchange, privacy enabling mechanisms, and digital identity types across multiple chains. With this OC, the following outcomes are expected: o Sharding: Sharded system a DLT into a federation of smaller groups of maintainers without lowering the security of the entire network. Smaller maintainer groups require less energy to exchange and verify transactions drastically reducing the CO2 footprint. o Consensus-less DLTs: Classical DLTs use costly consensus protocols to agree on a global order for all the transactions. Recent studies show that it is possible to implement DLT functionalities without communication between miners. o Secure data removal: Classical DLTs rely on storing a complete list of transactions to enforce data integrity. However, such an approach requires ever-growing storage capacities leading to unsustainable expenses. Techniques allowing to safely delete a part to solve this problem are expected. o Task management and dynamic load distribution: intelligent load distribution systems that dynamically assign tasks to idle infrastructure based on machine learning algorithms. These systems could predict when an infrastructure will be idle and plan intensive tasks for those periods, thus optimizing the use of resources in real time. o Integration between public and private infrastructure: considering how public infrastructure is made use of, such as municipal data centers, idle during certain hours, or even private infrastructure resources with idle capacity on weekends or 18", "metadata": {"source_file": "trustchain_ngi_eu_Open-Call-5_Open-Call-Document-1.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/trustchain_ngi_eu_Open-Call-5_Open-Call-Document-1.pdf", "page_number": 19, "chunk_id": "trustchain_ngi_eu_Open-Call-5_Open-Call-Document-1_p19_c1", "author": "Alexandre Relvão", "creationDate": "D:20241108124749+00'00'"}}

CreatorCredentials.cc will develop a software application and a legal framework that can be used by media organisations to provide services to issue verifiable creator credentials. The app will be based on new and upcoming W3C and ISO standards for decentralised content identification (ISCC), decentralised identifiers (DIDs), verifiable credentials (VCs), and other established online reputation systems. It will be aligned with emerging European regulations on digital identity, such as eIDAS, as well as the directives on copyright (DSM), the Digital Services Act (DSA) and Digital Markets Act (DMA). With the app, media organisations will be able to issue verifiable credentials to creators and rightsholders in providing authentication and attribution to increase the trustworthiness of declarations and claims to digital media content online. This will increase trust and transparency of the digital media markets. The app will be developed as an open source, dockerized service that can be installed without permission by media organisations intending to offer VC issuer services. It will facilitate the onboarding process, mutual authentication, and verification of credential issuers and creators based on novel SSI trust frameworks. The app will support the creation and issuance of various credential types and subjects, depending on the use case of the creator or rightsholder.

SSCD securely stores locally or remotely the private key which cannot be exported. When a user wants to sign a digital document, SSCD generates a digital signature using the private key and the document digest. SSCDs are used in applications that require high level of assurance, such as person authentication, identity verification, and signing legal documents, etc. To implement an SSCD, combination of hardware and software measures are required to ensure device security and signature validity. 24", "metadata": {"source_file": "trustchain_ngi_eu_Open-Call-5_Open-Call-Document-1.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/trustchain_ngi_eu_Open-Call-5_Open-Call-Document-1.pdf", "page_number": 25, "chunk_id": "trustchain_ngi_eu_Open-Call-5_Open-Call-Document-1_p25_c1", "author": "Alexandre Relvão", "creationDate": "D:20241108124749+00'00'"}}

USAPI simplifies the integration of various systems and services by presenting a standard set of methods and protocols for exchanging data and functionality. Project aims to work on a flexible identity management for end- users allowing them to control their trust relationships (private keys). USAPI Library allows developers to build eID applications and Identity Wallets that can easily integrate with multiple systems without having to learn the details of each individual SSCD interface. USAPI simplifies the development process, reduces costs, and accelerates time-tomarket for new eID applications, making it particularly useful in the context of citizen's digital services, where multiple independent services need to interact with each other seamlessly. o TREVO: Trusted Electronic Voting Voting systems have evolved during the last hundreds of years to become more sophisticated and complex, starting from paper-based ballots up to electronic voting machines and internet voting which have been introduced as new voting technologies. However, electronic-based methods have raised concerns about security and the potential for tampering results, manipulation or hacking. The TREVO project aims to revolutionize electronic voting systems by employing decentralized identities rooted on blockchain and an SSI approach that puts the user at the centre of the process from the early phases of the design phase. The main objective of TREVO is to tackle main challenges in electronic voting that are still open, such as voter anonymity, ballot privacy, trusted tally/audit as well as verifiability. It employs blockchain technology and more specifically Decentralised Identities, Verifiable Credentials and state-of-the-art communication protocols and architectures, following the latest EU guidelines and regulations in terms of digital identities and data protection. The framework incorporates a mobile wallet that enables EU-wide interoperability for citizen authentication and authorization based on well-established technologies entailing trust from anchors of the public sector. A mobile application is the core of the project which will be cocreated with the end- users, keeping them in the loop from the ideation and design process up to the testing and evaluation, integrating their feedback through an iterative procedure. TREVO will be deployed and evaluated/validated in real use cases of a Greek municipality (Trikala) where direct citizen feedback is needed for addressing issues such as urban planning, wider regional strategies (e.g. energy or digital transition) and e-governance, leaving no one behind, including elderly people and vulnerable groups. 25", "metadata": {"source_file": "trustchain_ngi_eu_Open-Call-5_Open-Call-Document-1.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/trustchain_ngi_eu_Open-Call-5_Open-Call-Document-1.pdf", "page_number": 26, "chunk_id": "trustchain_ngi_eu_Open-Call-5_Open-Call-Document-1_p26_c1", "author": "Alexandre Relvão", "creationDate": "D:20241108124749+00'00'"}}

The system will allow users to manage their online identities and access community-centred internet services trusted high quality data according to their identity profile. The system development uses and will be open-source software. The system will be evaluated and disseminated to other communities. The system will be designed to be trustworthy and to preserve personal privacy. It will be aligned with decentralised identity models, including considering EIDAS and build on existing and emerging digital identity technology solutions, but adapted to the target and other similar communities of practice. The system will be driven by the end-user community and developed by a team of developers and researchers from Pangea and UPC. The system, extended with decentralised digital identity according to the community of practice needs, has the potential to significantly impact the lives of communities involving marginalised citizens working on digital services and circular devices. The system will give users greater control over their online identities and make accessing essential digital services easier. The system will also help to promote trust and privacy online in more efficient and scalable communities. o The Social Wallet We’re rapidly moving into a digital-first world, which requires a different set of skills. That creates a real risk that certain groups of people will be left behind.

Finally, the proposed project is completely aligned with TRUSTCHAIN’s mission, objectives, challenges, proposed solutions and even several illustrative examples for project ideas. o IM4DEC: Identity Management for the Digital Emergency Call UN convention Article 9 requires countries to take measures for the full and equal participation of persons with disabilities, including access to communication and information services. Despite this, there are still about 1 million deaf and hard of hearing persons in Europe who currently rely on outdated technology (e.g. fax) and help from others to make an emergency call. DEC112 is a non-profit association that has designed and developed a standard-conform infrastructure (ETSI TS 103 479) for deaf emergency chats (ETSI TS 103 698). Since 2019, the association is now operating a system in Austria in collaboration with the Ministry of Interior that connects emergency chats to the appropriate emergency communication centre by utilising location information. However, still a number of challenges exist that are addressed in the proposal and will - in case of funding - be implemented and made available as open source. o WIDE: Web3 Identity Integration for DAOs and Education The project proposal focuses on developing a Decentralized Identity (DID) bridge prototype for managing user identities and connecting the European Commission's eIDAS 2.0 initiative with decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) on public-permissionless distributed ledger technologies (DLT). This use- case agnostic solution aims to enhance credential access for Web3- native organizations and protect individuals' data privacy rights. The solution, WIDE, aims to combine existing technologies from traditional finance and the cryptocurrency sector with innovative DID concepts. It features a novel architecture that preserves privacy and user control, while freeing users from the responsibility of managing their data directly. Our DID bridging client relies on existing wallet solutions to empower DAOs to access user data without the need for custom integrations with individual identity solutions. This project's anticipated impact includes a component for composable verification of verifiers to the eIDAS ecosystem and improving the composability of eIDAS Type 2 configuration- compliant solutions for improved market access of DAOs to the European Economic Area (EEA). The prototype will undergo testing in three (3) distinct scenarios: voting using EVM wallets, enabling DAOs to verify credentials, and integrating with existing DAO frameworks like DAOHaus ‘Moloch v.3’. 27", "metadata": {"source_file": "trustchain_ngi_eu_Open-Call-5_Open-Call-Document-1.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/trustchain_ngi_eu_Open-Call-5_Open-Call-Document-1.pdf", "page_number": 28, "chunk_id": "trustchain_ngi_eu_Open-Call-5_Open-Call-Document-1_p28_c1", "author": "Alexandre Relvão", "creationDate": "D:20241108124749+00'00'"}}

It offers an abstraction layer with a universal interface, which means that clients of this tool can create DIDs without having to know or implement details of the underlying DID method (which may involve blockchains, web servers, or any other technology). This tool can be self- hosted, it should not be operated by a single centralized authority. o EVI Electric Vehicle Identity: Protecting driver privacy, while streamlining transactions in public charging stations Drivers of electric vehicles (EVs) face significant data privacy risks when charging their vehicles in Public Charging Stations. Each charge point operator (CPO) uses different software to manage its stations and collect charging fees. Drivers are forced to sign up with multiple applications to start a charging session in Public Charging Stations. This further complicates drivers’ experience as each application requires personal and financial data before it enables the driver to initiate a charging session. An underappreciated risk with the dispersion of information across multiple platforms is that vehicle and user data can be used to pinpoint users’ locations and everyday activities. Drivers do not retain control on how 3rd parties exploit their personal data. For example, CPOs can use data related to users’ daily location, vehicle type and frequency of charging sessions for targeted advertising or provide these data to 3rd party advertisers that seek to target specific user groups. Most drivers do not fully understand the potential uses of their private data whenever they sign up for an EV charging application. o IS-CIS: Information Sharing: consensual, innate & sequential We propose a generic framework that mimics human nature in disclosure of identity and has a myriad of different social and business applications. It can allow the disclosure of sensitive medical data for the purposes of recruiting a cohort of a medical trial or guide the disclosure of personal data in a social setting. It could become a de facto standard for identity disclosure from human to IT and enable complex multi-person chains of disclosure. It reserves control and repeal rights in the hands of the individual. It allows discoverability. It places an onus on the asker to justify and convince the askee. It retains a permanent record of who requested, and who granted, what and when. Our proposed framework does not replace validation– it does not verify the data in the system with external sources of truth – as such it is synergic with all other solutions that do provide that validation. Its purpose is to hand a safe, verifiable control to the owner of the data. 28", "metadata": {"source_file": "trustchain_ngi_eu_Open-Call-5_Open-Call-Document-1.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/trustchain_ngi_eu_Open-Call-5_Open-Call-Document-1.pdf", "page_number": 29, "chunk_id": "trustchain_ngi_eu_Open-Call-5_Open-Call-Document-1_p29_c1", "author": "Alexandre Relvão", "creationDate": "D:20241108124749+00'00'"}}
{"text": "o PRIVE: Privacy Respecting Identity Verification Enabler for Digital Identity Wallets PRIVÈ extends the decentralized user-centric identity management framework by building an open source library that can be added as an extension to any SSI wallet on the Holder side to enable the use of hardware-based keys. This offers the possibility to bind Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to the wallet of the holder and transfer the root of trust of the SSI ecosystem purely to the digital wallet by considering an underlying Trusted Component as part of the wallet, without making any assumptions on the trustworthiness of the other layers. This enables digital identity wallets to align with emerging regulations and standards like eIDAS that require higher level of assurances for services. At the same time, we make sure that privacy- enhancing properties like selective-disclosure are fully supported, in order to make the wallet compliant with privacy regulations like GDPR. To this end, PRIVÈ utilizes a privacy-preserving cryptographic protocol, namely Direct Anonymous Attestation (DAA) to provide verifiable evidence and assurances about the presented VC’s origin and integrity. We can now enforce that a VC can only be issued by an attested Issuer and that this VC is bound to the Holder’s device (wallet), overcoming the current limitations of bare proof-of-possession of a sw-based key. PRIVÈ follows a user- centric design and implementation, co-evaluated with the end users, thus, envisioning to achieve high level of user acceptance.

Rightful data owners are not actively involved in the data value chain, and this results in low trust and willingness to share data, hindering the growth of a European data market. Based on a patented multicast end-to-end encryption scheme and smart contracts, Ecosteer decentralized consent management technology – the Data Visibility Control Overlay (DVCO) – allows individuals to unilaterally grant & revoke visibility over data streams generated by their devices to selected stakeholders, as mandated by the GDPR. Additionally, a smart contract implements a compensation mechanism based on tokens, incentivizing data sharing. Within NGI TrustChain Call #2, Ecosteer will develop the Data Ownership Orchestration Framework (DOOF), a set of open SDKs, libraries and Smart Contracts that allows data owners to exercise data ownership rights – i.e. grant, revoke and monetize data visibility.

For instance, mobility data is used to optimize public transportation, improve mobile and wireless networks and study human contacts to help public health experts track viral diseases. However, mobility data is a very sensitive type of data, since mapping the movements of individuals can reveal personal information. Anonymization cannot be limited to suppressing metadata containing the subject’s identity, because the origin, the destination and even the intermediate points of a trajectory may allow re-identifying the individual who followed it (de Montjoye et al, 2013). Proper anonymization requires masking detailed spatiotemporal Information. Currently, the standard approach to building anonymized datasets is centralized: the subjects send their data to a controller, who takes care of producing an anonymized mobility data set. This requires subjects to blindly trust the controller, which is not acceptable in most cases. There is another risk inherent to mobility data, which is the possibility to re-identify individuals in anonymized datasets by cross- referencing them with other existing or newly published datasets (Srivatsa et al, 2012). Hence, the requirement for anonymity of mobility data must be controlled in consideration of publicly available data. The goals of our project are threefold: - develop a decentralized method, based on utility-preserving k-anonymity, that will allow anonymization of mobility data in a way that guarantees that even the controller cannot re-identify individuals in their datasets. - create an auditing tool that enables data controllers to audit their proprietary datasets for de- anonymization risks and anonymize the data if risks are uncovered using a centralized k-anonymity algorithm. - create a verification tool enabling individuals and companies to uncover public datasets that contain similar trajectories to theirs. o MorphMetro - Secure and privacy-preserving exchange and analysis of measured data based on homomorphic encryption 31", "metadata": {"source_file": "trustchain_ngi_eu_Open-Call-5_Open-Call-Document-1.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/trustchain_ngi_eu_Open-Call-5_Open-Call-Document-1.pdf", "page_number": 32, "chunk_id": "trustchain_ngi_eu_Open-Call-5_Open-Call-Document-1_p32_c1", "author": "Alexandre Relvão", "creationDate": "D:20241108124749+00'00'"}}
{"text": "Measured data obtained by measuring devices and its subsequent analyses (measured data accuracy, errors, measurement uncertainty, regulation compliance, etc.) are pillars for quality assurance (QA) in a wide spectrum of various industries (food industry, pharmacy, etc.). Currently, there is no universally accepted protocol for the machine-interpretable structuring and digital dissemination of measurement data, leading to concerns in data governance and user privacy. Fortunately, the science of measurement (metrology) is undergoing digital transformation, as evidenced by BIPM's recent Joint Statement of Intent. Our solution builds on emerging new standards (SI-Digital, Digital Calibration Certificates, etc.) to add a crucial component for digitalizing QA reliant on measured data. We propose an open-source solution for the secure exchange of data (measured data and subsequent analyses) in use cases where one needs analysis of measured data to be carried out by a third-party data analysis service. This “third party entity” operates independently of the entity (organization, department, team) involved in data collection most often if: - there is a need to ensure an unbiased analytical perspective (often prescribed by metrology regulations) and/or - the analysis is carried out as commercial service offered on the market and/or - there is a separate “in-house” analytical department/team within the same organisation In each case it must be ensured that data security is maintained, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or data misuse, including privacy risks if measured data contains possible Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Shortly said, our proposal has a simple input → measured data, and a simple output → analysis of measured data. However, it will use state-of-the-art technologies (blockchain, homomorphic encryption) and emerging standards and architectures established in the EU space (European Blockchain Service Infrastructure (EBSI), Alastria, Digital Calibration Certificates (DCC)) in order to make the solution trustworthy, scalable and compliant with prevailing and upcoming regulations. o SURE - Synthetic Data: Utility, Regulatory compliance, and Ethical privacy Clearbox AI, an award-winning tech startup based in Turin, Italy, specializes in facilitating AI and Analytics projects through Synthetic Data generation.

The proposal confronts the challenges posed by the rapid evolution of AI, particularly in safeguarding user privacy and data governance. AI presents distinctive privacy risks, including potential individual identification in anonymized data. Clearbox AI's solution centers on Privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs), focusing on Synthetic Data. This method preserves real-world data's statistical properties and predictive capabilities while ensuring privacy.

Harnessing this value and the vast amount of data available can generate huge revenues for online service platform providers. It is common for data owners not to take advantage of this value in an adequate way and often give or share their data for free or pay with it for the use of a service. In general, these platforms offer services without preserving the privacy of users' data, without secure data exchange, without identification of the data or its provenance, or without providing mechanisms to track, explain and validate the data. The main limitation of data sharing platforms is users' lack of trust in privacy and control to manage their data. The user's perception of helplessness is increased by not knowing how their data is used and with whom it is shared. Therefore, it is necessary to preserve user data privacy and secure data exchange, in order to build trust among participants and ensure data sovereignty. Leveraging the capabilities offered by blockchain technology and the use of advanced cryptographic technologies to ensure data sovereignty in the third-party data sharing, this project will focus on delivering four main components: 1) A consent management system based on self-sovereign digital identity authentications and interactions, 2) A privacy preserving authentication mechanism to enable privacy preserving authentications thus boosting anonymization, 3) A proxy re-encryption scheme to guarantee e2e data privacy 4) A blockchain notarized audit-trail to guarantee traceability, non-repudiation and accountability. dGUARD offers an innovative solution that harnesses the power of self-sovereign digital identity, Zero- Knowledge Proofs and proxy re- encryption with a comprehensive approach designed to revolutionize the way data exchange procedures are carried out, with a primary focus on improving consent management, strengthen data security, privacy and anonymity, while ensuring robust process accountability. o NG-SC- Next Generation Smart Cities In the rapidly evolving landscape of the Next Generation Internet (NGI), data storage and management are undergoing a profound transformation.

{"text": "centralized entities and corporations held dominion over vast data stores. However, the NGI heralds a paradigm shift, prioritizing user-centric data governance, where individual users maintain control and ownership of their data, and even more intriguingly, their IoT devices become active contributors to this new ecosystem. In recent years, the idea of smart cities in which the infrastructure layer and data acquisition/storage is made available by government entities has gained significant traction. This is mostly attributed to the higher availability of cost-effective IoT devices/sensors, and growing connectivity and bandwidth of networks. However, the financial investments required to setup, and maintain the infrastructure are a high barrier to entry. Moreover, these infrastructures are commonly centralized into three layers namely, data acquisition layer, storage and computation layer, and finally the application layer in which users and companies participate in by leveraging the data. This project envisions a future where users actively participate and maintain all three core infrastructure layers. To realize this, we propose a decentralized model that allows both users and their smart devices to contribute building a decentralized infrastructure. The solution builds on a paradigm shift in the way data driven computation occurs. As such, data never leaves the device, instead computation is broken down into independent sets, and migrated across the network. This guarantees data privacy, and ownership whilst at the same time, makes use of the currently untapped computational resources of IoT devices. Our strategy involves harnessing advancements in Multi-Party Computation (MPC) technology, advancing a novel MPC protocol to a demonstrative phase. All software of the platform and the MPC protocol will be made open-source to further establish trust and inclusivity of the solution. In summary, our project seeks to empower users to actively participate and be rewarded in the data economy, fundamentally transforming data ownership in the NGI era. We propose a user-centric data governance model, fortified by cutting-edge technology, and a decentralized resource marketplace that enables users to take control of their data and computational resources. This vision aligns perfectly with the evolving landscape of the NGI, where data is not just a commodity but a democratized and user- empowering currency. o DUME - Decentralised User-Centric Media Extension Tidy City encourages both individuals and organisations to routinely capture high- resolution images of streets and roads.

However, like many contemporary platforms, once users submit their data to Tidy City, they relinquish much of the control over it. Project DUME aims to change the centralised nature of digital platforms like Tidy City by: 1. Extending Solid Protocol that adeptly manages large-scale media datasets with decentralised web platforms. 2.

The protocol should support rich metadata annotations, ensuring indexing mechanisms deliver quick searches and filtering based on this metadata. Specific AI access control ensures that AI model trainers can access the requisite data without compromising other personal or sensitive data. This involves creating specialised 'views' or 'profiles' of the data specifically curated for AI training. Given the dynamic nature of data (new images added constantly), the protocol must support robust versioning mechanisms, allowing users and applications to fetch historical data versions efficiently.

In a landscape crowded with assistive technologies for ADHD, this project distinguishes itself by integrating robust privacy measures at its core. Existing ADHD assistive technologies often overlook privacy and security concerns, leaving users vulnerable to data risks and profiling. To counter these challenges, AURORA MINDS implements a multi-layered security framework, including Identity Management (IdM) and Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs). This approach enhances data security, strictly controls access to sensitive information, and ensures compliance with data privacy regulations. The project leverages machine learning techniques such as federated learning and local differential privacy to protect sensitive user data during collection and analysis, aligning with GDPR requirements. Aurora Minds adopts a human-centric design approach, tailoring personal data collection from a child while s/he interacts with a serious tablet animation game to cater a unique ADHD risk assessment process. The project benefits various stakeholders, including children, parents, educators, and clinicians. Children are examined through a specialized application supporting their behavioral unique requirements and independence. Parents receive reassurance regarding data confidentiality, gaining insights into ADHD risk assessment and relevant information to provide better support.

The emphasis on PETs and federated machine learning not only bolsters data privacy but also mitigates legal risks associated with data sharing, enhancing data quality for effective decision-making. o OIDC PRINCE - OpenID Connect with PRIvacy-eNhanced ConsEnts The OIDC PRINCE project aims to enhance the privacy support in user consents used in OpenID Connect authentication and authorization processes. Nowadays the consent to access the claims about end-user and authentication events (e.g., gender, birthdate, phone number), may have associated privacy issues. Users need to be informed regarding the potential risk of providing consent for the personal information access by services/entities that may not be trusted by the user and the OpenID Provider, which is responsible to manage the authentication and authorization. OpenID PRINCE introduces the proof of privacy regulations compliance (e.g., compliance with GDPR) in the OIDC discovery and registration processes using data privacy vocabulary (DPV) specification that can be certified by entities external to the OIDC authentication process. These proofs can be stored securely in a EMV compliant blockchain. OIDC PRINCE also enables privacy analysis to assess the risk of services accessing the end-user private information. This analysis, performed by Fuzzy Logic models considers the claims which access is being requested and the profile of the service requesting the access, for instance if it is a service associated with acquisitions or a service for education and learning. OIDC PRINCE contributes to enhance the support of privacy in OpenID connect by enabling informed consents, and by minimizing the data sharing with entities that are not trusted, or that do not provide evidence of being trustworthy in terms of privacy management. o PECS - Privacy Enrooted Car Systems People’s privacy control over the personal data that they generate and consume while they drive modern cars is extremely weak at present.

PECS revolutionises modern car ecosystems for what concerns the processing of personal data. It does so by advancing, tailoring to the specific domain and, ultimately, combining together both soft and hard privacy measures. The project raises drivers’ soft privacy through the PECS interface for static and dynamic control of personal data, so that drivers can decide what to share and with whom and when, as well as follow and control the flows of data at service run time by means of multy-sensory media techniques.

Indeed, SADS can be used in various ways to simplify and streamline data sharing processes, and to secure and trace data transfers. Some of the main use cases include: Connected Cars: DID-IMP-enabled cars can automatically share data for tolls, parking, vehicle recharging (electricity or hydrogen), and other transportation-related processes, making the service more convenient for drivers. They can automatically deliver maintenance data with selected relevant bodies. Remote healthcare: SADS systems can enable remote healthcare services, such as telemedicine and patient monitoring, improving access to healthcare. Sensors can also collect data on patient health and behavior and control the delivery of this data with specific accredited personas. Cognitive Cities: IoT plays an important role in creating smarter, environment conscious and more efficient cities. Applications like smart traffic management, water and waste management, and public safety rely on secure data transfer to optimize operations and protect citizens' data.

Where, instead of AI models indiscriminately assimilating vast volumes of data, every fragment has a unique identifier and provenance. ProvenAI promises such a world, aspiring to construct a Decentralised Provenance Platform tailored specifically for unstructured data. It doesn’t stop at mere identification ; the objective is to ensure knowledge creators can trace how their content is utilised while receiving just compensation. Traditional platforms offer limited utility in the evolving realm of Generative AI and semantic searches.

{"text": "Identity and Homomorphic Encryption, coupled with DAO structures, we offer a framework where data privacy is not just a feature but the very foundation. While the current digital landscape offers decentralized solutions, many fail to put user privacy and data governance at the forefront. Our model diverges, ensuring every data interaction prioritizes user consent, traceability, and security. This commitment extends beyond mere encryption; it reshapes how data is stored, shared, and accessed, always keeping the user's rights at the centre. Through consistent collaboration and feedback loops with users and stakeholders, especially those from vulnerable settings like refugee camps, we craft a solution inherently aligned with their needs. Our co-creation ethos guarantees that our framework is not only technologically advanced but also deeply empathetic, understanding, and responsive to real-world user challenges. Moreover, our proposed framework introduces a paradigm where data sharing is both transparent and potentially beneficial for users, marrying user privacy with data governance seamlessly. This harmony between privacy and governance is pivotal in sectors beyond healthcare, finding resonance in finance, real estate, and more. Together as Hora e.V. with our industry-leading members, we are able to realise a paradigm shift on how user privacy and data governance is handled in a decentralized world. Thereby, we are in sync with TRUSTCHAIN's vision, which seeks to set a transformative benchmark. Open Call #3 - Economics and democracy This section lists Open Call 3 projects. Their mapping with the TRUSTCHAIN baseline technologies is at the time of writing this document under development. o ZKorum – Verifiable Moderation on eAgora The internet was initially designed to connect computers, not humans. Consequently, we find ourselves in the midst of an online identity crisis: either we remain fully anonymous and unverifiable, akin to bots, or we adopt public profiles, risking the compromise of our privacy. This dilemma exposes us to a plethora of issues, including scams, stalking, doxing, bullying, identity theft, etc. The online trust deficit, coupled with the rampant dissemination of false information, extreme opinions, armies of bots, and polarizing algorithms, has transformed social media into a toxic environment. Here, diverse viewpoints are met with hostility rather than open dialogues. Gartner predicts that by 2025, half of users will abandon or significantly reduce their social media usage. Enter ZKorum, an open-source, privacy-preserving and verifiable social network designed to empower individuals, especially those who are vulnerable or marginalized, to engage in free civil discourse, paving the way for a more resilient democracy. Through the integration of Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) and Zero Knowledge Proof cryptography (ZKP), ZKorum enables users to anonymously prove attributes like personhood, age, profession, gender, nationality, etc. Additionally, 40", "metadata": {"source_file": "trustchain_ngi_eu_Open-Call-5_Open-Call-Document-1.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/trustchain_ngi_eu_Open-Call-5_Open-Call-Document-1.pdf", "page_number": 41, "chunk_id": "trustchain_ngi_eu_Open-Call-5_Open-Call-Document-1_p41_c1", "author": "Alexandre Relvão", "creationDate": "D:20241108124749+00'00'"}}

Currently in the decentralized identity world, the credential issuance and verification space is populated by multiple standards, that define cryptography, file formats and transport protocols. If two decentralized services, such as a credential issuer (or a verifier) and a mobile wallet, speak different protocols or misuse an existing protocol, the problems generated from this situation can be hard to trace, would have long lasting consequences and be challenging to resolve. 42", "metadata": {"source_file": "trustchain_ngi_eu_Open-Call-5_Open-Call-Document-1.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/trustchain_ngi_eu_Open-Call-5_Open-Call-Document-1.pdf", "page_number": 43, "chunk_id": "trustchain_ngi_eu_Open-Call-5_Open-Call-Document-1_p43_c1", "author": "Alexandre Relvão", "creationDate": "D:20241108124749+00'00'"}}

Born from our experience with developing the open source identity solution DIDroom, DIDimo's main goal is to boost the market adoption of decentralized identity services, by offering anyone to test the wallets' compliance to multiple protocols as well as a marketplace for service providers. Briefly DIDimo will allow: End-users, developers or software integrators, can assess the compliance of a credential issuer/verifier to multiple standards (we aim for: SD-JWT, W3C-VC, OpenID4VCI, OpenID4VP, vc-di-bbs) by entering its endpoint in a web interface (or via API). Developers/Solution providers can submit their issuance/verification services to DIDimo in order to have a compliance check, receive a blue-stamp if the result is positive (or a red-flag with a list of the issues found) and to list their service in the marketplace of the platform. For every bluestamp, DIDimo produces a \"badge\" in the form of verifiable credential (W3C-VC) which can display on the website of the credential service provider (or a third party, such as participatory democracy platform, a marketplace, a social media etc.) using an iframe. End-users (and various stakeholders) can browse and compare the list of submitted services in the marketplace. End-users can provide feedback and rating of the services, adding a community driven trustworthiness on top of the technical assessment, usable by all the parties in a data exchange ecosystem. o TAC! - Traceability and Trust in the Agrifood supply Chains The Enismaro Project offers an end-to-end solution able to track and trace the food production process and to enforce transparency by disclosing information about the products to the parties of the chain and to the end consumers.

Different initiatives across Europe develop frameworks to guarantee that the use and exchange of data is done in environments (data spaces) ensuring not only trustworthiness, governance and sovereignty, but also the generation of added value for participants. We usually think of these spaces to be used by large companies, but local retail and businesses could profit from them too. We shop at local groceries, bakeries or corner stores, which have information about everyday shopping activity but do not record or analyze it. Buyers (end users) have no incentives to share their data either. VALUE4ALL will create a data aggregation platform to incentivize data sharing and create quality datasets. On one hand, customers will be able to scan a QR code located at the stores to register information about their transactions through a short form (what you bought today, at which time, how was your experience). In return, they will get tokens, which will allow them to earn rewards, discounts or other advantages for their next shoppings, which will encourage them to share valuable and real information. No personal data will be required, so privacy will be kept. On the other hand, data will be registered and organized in a structured way so local businesses will find a way to improve their service level and reputation, as well as the customer experience and loyalty. Furthermore, as the quality of generated data is assured, these data sets can be offered and monetized in different and wider data spaces and platforms so they can also be valuable beyond local areas, strengthening the global data value chain. o AUTHBOND - Authentic Bond Operating Network for DAOs Contracting in Web3 has an accountability problem because the pseudonymity of contributors diminishes their eagerness to focus on delivery. To address this shortcoming, our project introduces bid bonds to the TrustChain platform and makes it available to Web3. The concept is prevalent in traditional public and private sector contracting, but has yet to be implemented for Web3 to provide transparency to digital trade and democratise on-chain economies. Bid bonds can effectively mitigate risks associated with project defaults, particularly in grant programs that currently rely on milestone-based payments by requiring contractors to deposit a security. 44", "metadata": {"source_file": "trustchain_ngi_eu_Open-Call-5_Open-Call-Document-1.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/trustchain_ngi_eu_Open-Call-5_Open-Call-Document-1.pdf", "page_number": 45, "chunk_id": "trustchain_ngi_eu_Open-Call-5_Open-Call-Document-1_p45_c1", "author": "Alexandre Relvão", "creationDate": "D:20241108124749+00'00'"}}

Our solution proposes to replace traditional centralised third parties with a combination of Web3 credentials and staking contracts. This innovative solution not only streamlines the process but also introduces more efficient contracting methods in Web3 and beyond. These privacy-preserving yet metadata-rich bonds can induce legitimacy for digital identities that are part of the TrustChain Large Scale Pilot (LSP) and provide utility for the WIDE solution by bolstering industry adoption, as well as increasing transparency for users contracting in Web3. Through the use case of awarding contracts for running nodes of a decentralised remote procedure call (RPC) network and together with the RPC gateway provider PORTERS, we want to bring the next generation of services procurement to users of Web3 and the TrustChain platform. o Trust-ICMF - Trusted International Contract Management Framework In the context of international trade, the lack of interoperability, standardisation, and trust among parties leads to the persistence of contracts on paper-based media, whereas the digitization of contracts in human-machine readable form, interoperability, and decentralisation could lead to significant advantages such as: streamlining and automating workflows based on structured interoperable data, efficient identification of parties, contract drafting and distributed validation alongside the development of an open and sustainable ecosystem based on verifiable data exchange. Given these clear needs, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) / Trade Programme and the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) are beginning to propose mechanisms for modular and standardised composition of international contracts.

The experience part of the wallet will be an Open Source Software to enable public inspection, contribution, and longevity. For the DID module, we will utilize DIDROOM, a product from the NGI ecosystem. This innovation bridges the gap between Web 2.0 tools like the ones Google and Meta offer, which often compromise user privacy and monetise user data. This project aims to empower users with decentralised solutions to protect their privacy and deliver reward tokens instead of impression-based advertising. As consumer trust in centralized platforms wanes, there is a growing need for privacy-focused alternatives that allow travelers to access digital tools without compromising personal information. With QX Travel Experience Wallet, users can still utilise essential digital tools like navigation, exploration, and communication without exposing their data. The city- to-tourist connections utilize web3 wallets that enable tourists to collect city tokens and redeem rewards, further envisioned as a European Travel Coin. The platform will serve as eWallet for tourists and as a Wallet as a Service for agencies and cities, enabling the democratisation of tourist data and tourist engagement for economic prosperity and democratic principles. By integrating decentralised governance models, prioritizing individual privacy, and promoting fair practices for the tourist experience, this initiative democratizes the digital experience and data. This project aligns with the NGI TrustChain's Open Call #3 goal by contributing to economic vitality through data marketplaces and data democratisation in smart cities, ensuring that the benefits of technological innovation are inclusive, participatory, and accessible to all. o PLD - Flowback: Enhancing Democratic Decision-Making with Predictive Liquid Democracy 46", "metadata": {"source_file": "trustchain_ngi_eu_Open-Call-5_Open-Call-Document-1.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/trustchain_ngi_eu_Open-Call-5_Open-Call-Document-1.pdf", "page_number": 47, "chunk_id": "trustchain_ngi_eu_Open-Call-5_Open-Call-Document-1_p47_c1", "author": "Alexandre Relvão", "creationDate": "D:20241108124749+00'00'"}}

High electricity consumption, driven by resource-intensive consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work (PoW), the need for widespread transaction verification, and the large amounts of data exchanged across the network contribute to their negative environmental impact. Efforts to reduce this impact must navigate a delicate balance between maintaining decentralization and security while improving energy efficiency. The objective is to optimize DLTs by leveraging digital identities, trustworthy data, and novel economic mechanisms while balancing technological advancement with sustainability. In order to achieve TrustChain vision, it is expected that applicants will employ digital identities, trustworthy data, and already designed novel mechanisms for the ecosystems’ economy, in order to achieve high energy efficiency and optimisation of particular DLTs.
