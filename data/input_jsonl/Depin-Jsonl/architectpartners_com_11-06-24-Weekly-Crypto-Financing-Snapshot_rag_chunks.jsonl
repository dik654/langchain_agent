DePins typically incentivize individuals to contribute unused capacity from physical assets - such as mobile Chainway Labs 10/31 14.0 ND Early Stage VC Developer Tools & Infrastructure Founders Fund routers Helium, smartphone sensors Hivemapper), or computing storage Storj - through tokenized rewards and onchain administration. TITLES 11/1 12.2 ND Early Stage VC DApp: Consumer, Media Not Disclosed The myriad permutations often involve three elements - 1) physical infrastructure, such as phones or storage devices; 2) middleware to link the physical assets or attributes to a blockchain, similar to the way oracles Gelato Network 10/28 11.0 ND Later Stage VC Developer Tools & Infrastructure Hack VC integrate external data resources for onchain applications; and 3) a blockchain to manage and administer the network, including tracking use and remittance of rewards to incentive participants.

According to some recent reports, total revenues across all DePin projects may be a paltry $15 million (yes, LAST 52 WEEKS DEAL COUNT LAST 52 WEEKS CRYPTO FINANCING BY CAPITAL INVESTED $ in M million with an “Mˮ) even while funding valuations begin to soar. One group that may be bucking that trend is Glow Labs, an Ethereum-based solar project that closed a $30 million round this week led by Framework Ventures and Union Square. Glow rewards owners of solar generation capacity with their native GLW tokens in exchange for excess electricity output, coupled with USDC payments to monetize available carbon credits. It's certainly an interesting application, that could eliminate several thorny problems with distributed solar - not least of which includes the initial cost and lead time needed to bring additional kWh online, as well as the limited lifespan and disposal challenges of distributed storage, both of which hamper the ability to scale current projects for future demand load. There is still much for Glow Labs and others in the DePin space to prove, but the space presents an increasingly intriguing connection for Web3 technologies to address challenges in the physical real world that most of us inhabit. 28 $161M ------------------------------------ Contact ryan@architectpartners.com to schedule a meeting. 10/28  11/03 10/28  11/03", "metadata": {"source_file": "architectpartners_com_11-06-24-Weekly-Crypto-Financing-Snapshot.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/architectpartners_com_11-06-24-Weekly-Crypto-Financing-Snapshot.pdf", "page_number": 1, "chunk_id": "architectpartners_com_11-06-24-Weekly-Crypto-Financing-Snapshot_p1_c1", "title": "11-06-24 Weekly Crypto Financing Snapshot"}}
