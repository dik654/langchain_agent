{"text": "Web3 and Artiﬁcial Intelligence: The State of Play | February 2024 Executive Summary AI is dominating the narrative as one of the most promising trends of 2024. Goldman Sachs estimates that AI adoption could drive almost $7T in global economic growth over ten years, with productivity growing 1.5% faster annually over the same period.1 AI is recognized as the next signiﬁcant technological shift after the evolution of the internet, mobile, and the cloud. AI and blockchain technologies could build on each other and compound over time: Blockchain can act as a source of reliable data for AI, enhancing the trust and privacy of data without intermediaries. It can also facilitate the decentralization of compute power and storage across companies and geographies and provide alternatives to the big tech monopolies. In turn, AI has the potential to revolutionize decentralized networks and applications and drive massive adoption of Web3 technologies. AI can enable smart contracts to make decisions based on dynamic on-chain data, creating new functionalities. When AI and blockchain are combined, they can lead to major industry data and information security advances, like zero-knowledge machine learning (ZKML) based solutions. Still, blockchain and AI technologies are currently at different levels of adoption. The challenges to adopting blockchain+AI are mainly scalability, compatibility, and governance issues. Blockchain networks are still being developed and may not be able to process with speed the high volume and complexity of data that AI systems require. As the technologies advance, blockchain+AI could complement and elevate each other, resulting in a more diverse and enriched technological landscape. The research and development activity in the blockchain+AI ﬁeld has been consistently rising over the last ﬁve years and resulted in 6.9k blockchain+AI -related GitHub repositories and 539k GitHub pull requests, 1.5k ﬁled patents, and 5.6k research publications as of December 31, 2023.2 The market sentiment has been optimistic about the growth potential of AI on-chain. The market capitalization of the top 15 AI-related tokens reached $12Bn in 2023 and showed an impressive growth of 443% in 2023 compared to 108% for the total crypto market capitalization.3 There is a wave of new startups working at the intersection of blockchain+AI and developing code writing tools, decentralized data storage, compute infrastructure for AI, content authenticity, privacy, and AI-enabled Web3 security solutions. The VC funding of the blockchain+AI startups exceeded $0.6Bn in 2023.4 Besides driving the formation of new startups, AI technology could signiﬁcantly affect existing digital asset companies by helping them to optimize expenses, increase revenues, and build moats. At TenSquared, we look for great companies that have demonstrated product-market ﬁt and are addressing real pain points at the intersection of blockchain and AI. We are looking beyond the hype to ﬁnd ways that these technologies can transform the future of businesses and our lives and have exponential outcomes. 1) - Goldman Sachs, Generative AI - Part I: Laying Out the Investment Framework 2) - GitHub, World Intellectual Property Organization, Dimensions.ai 3) - CoinGecko, as of December 31, 2023 4) - Pitchbook TenSquared Capital, LLC | Proprietary 3", "metadata": {"source_file": "tensquared_com_10SQ-Web3+AI-Report-Feb'24.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/tensquared_com_10SQ-Web3+AI-Report-Feb'24.pdf", "page_number": 3, "chunk_id": "tensquared_com_10SQ-Web3+AI-Report-Feb'24_p3_c1", "title": "10SQ-Research-AI-Blockchain-14", "creationDate": "D:20240531123148-04'00'"}}
{"text": "Web3 and Artiﬁcial Intelligence: The State of Play | February 2024 I. Why AI Needs Blockchain: Blockchain-based Solutions for AI There are a few areas where blockchain technology can provide viable solutions to fundamental problems of AI: Blockchain solves the trust problem for AI data. It can provide an essential framework to anchor content's authenticity on-chain and build incentives to collect and share real-world data. Blockchain could reduce the centralization risk of AI by facilitating the decentralization of AI infrastructure, including: data storage, data set creation, and compute power. Blockchain-based solutions could improve data privacy in AI by creating decentralized identities and offering more secure and efﬁcient cybersecurity systems. Blockchain Solves the Fundamental Trust Problem for AI Data AI is one of the fastest-growing technologies of our time, transforming businesses. The enterprise adoption of AI has been and will continue to take place at a staggering pace. Big Data has been key in accelerating the growth of AI. It is the proliferation of data that has enabled the training of AI to be smarter and more efﬁcient: AI systems integrate, synthesize, and interpret our data, unlocking knowledge. AI accelerates software system development, making companies more productive and efﬁcient by automating decision-making and recurring tasks and reducing human errors. Interaction with AI software and information becomes as easy as typing or speaking, which leads to broader adoption and more data produced. Thus, the pace of data creation and progress increases exponentially.

{"text": "Web3 and Artiﬁcial Intelligence: The State of Play | February 2024 However, there is a fundamental trust problem for AI: it becomes difﬁcult to tell what data is real and what is fake. As AI capabilities continue to evolve, proving content authenticity becomes a priority. Generative AI has the potential to create a ﬂood of misinformation and deepfakes as the cost of content creation falls. FUNDAMENTAL TRUST PROBLEM FOR AI Unalterable digital There has been a 10x increase in the number of histories, such as AI-powered fraud (mainly deepfakes) detected blockchain records and globally across all industries from 2022 to 2023.1 In 2022, 66% of cybersecurity professionals digital signatures, become experienced deepfake content attacks within their the ground truth for organizations.2 Researchers predict that as much as 90% of online everything digital. content may be synthetically generated by 2026.3 Blockchain provides an essential framework to anchor the authenticity and provenance of content on-chain: Cryptographic digital signatures can verify content creators by validating the signature through a corresponding public key. Digital signatures use encryption and public-key cryptography to sign and verify digital content. Establishing a veriﬁable provenance record can also be used to differentiate between original and manipulated data. For example, Bundlr and Arweave are developing a standard known as the Digital Content Provenance Record. This standard will ensure that authentic digital content and data include an immutable cryptographic signature provided by the content creator and a cryptographic timestamp recorded on-chain. In January 2024, Fox Corp and Polygon released a blockchain-powered tool, \"Verify\", to ﬁght AI-generated media stories or deepfakes. Worldcoin is creating a digital identiﬁcation system called World ID. World ID aims to verify the authenticity of online content or interaction through the blockchain. It represents a potential solution for the proliferation of bots and deepfakes. As of November 2023, Worldcoin had 1M+ active users and 4M+ downloads from dozens of countries.

{"text": "Web3 and Artiﬁcial Intelligence: The State of Play | February 2024 Blockchain Could Reduce the Centralization Risk of AI AI augments the market centralization risk, where the large technology companies with the most data, compute infrastructure, capital and distribution capabilities (such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon) can generate signiﬁcant advantages. Centralization risk of the Large Language Model (LLM) market: There is a signiﬁcant risk that AI’s capital-intensive nature could concentrate power among a few players owning massive data facilities. A few winners in the AI market could charge prohibitive fees or make it hard for users and developers to switch to other providers. Global GPU shortage: Increased demand for training ML models, model complexity (size), and computation requirements have caused a global Graphics Processing Units (GPU) shortage and a corresponding price hike for NVIDIA GPUs.1 While the cost of training AI models can be signiﬁcant, it is nothing compared to the expenses incurred from handling daily user inferences (queries). The training of OpenAI's GPT-3 required 1,000 NVIDIA V100 GPUs, amounting to $12M.2 OpenAI’s estimated daily expenditure for model inference is approximately $700,000.3 GPT-3.5 employs 8 NVIDIA A100s per user interface, and it’s speculated that GPT-4 requires as many as 80 A100s per interface.4 Model training alone could hit 1% of US GDP in the next eight years.5 State-of-the-art Networks Are Growing In Size Record-setting Training Costs: At An Exponential Rate Using Price-performance Trend 1000 Other system costs Record-setting costs GPT-3 (175B) Megatron-Turing NLG (530B) $1M 100 scale) Turing-NLG (17.2B) $10K parameters) Megatron-LM (8.3B) 10 (log of T5 (11B) billions USDin $100 1 GPT-2 (1.5B) (in cost $1 Size BERT-Large (340M) 0.1 Training $0.01 Model ELMO (94M) 0.01 2019 2011 2013 2015 2017 2019 2021 2023 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Source: Nature.com, Gensyn Source: Epoch Al, This graph depicts the increasing costs of training machine learning (\"ML\") models.

Blockchain can facilitate the decentralization of AI infrastructure across companies and geographies and provide alternatives to the big tech monopolies. Decentralized AI infrastructure players align their platform incentives with their users through crypto tokens. They can ensure lower costs for developers to train their models and enable compute providers to monetize their idle compute resources, which is particularly relevant given the global GPU shortage. AI decentralized infrastructure examples include decentralized storage, compute power, machine learning, and data set creation.

{"text": "Web3 and Artiﬁcial Intelligence: The State of Play | February 2024 Decentralized Storage As changes in AI models can be recorded and used for learning new data, decentralized data storage becomes particularly important. Companies such as Filecoin and Arweave have been playing an increasing role in the digital asset ecosystem. Their competitive advantages are decentralization, data privacy, security, incentive mechanisms, and competitive pricing, though retrieval times and speed are still a big issue and a major tradeoff of decentralization. The cost of decentralized ﬁle storage on blockchains such as Filecoin, Arweave, Swarm, StorJ, and Sia currently ranges from near zero to $4 per terabyte (TB) per month, according to Foresight Ventures. This is lower than the cost of traditional Web2 services such as Amazon Cloud or Microsoft Azure, where prices can range from $16 to $23 per TB of monthly storage.1 However, such considerations as the quality of service, service-level agreements, and other competitive advantages often outweigh cost considerations for most customers. So far, the main customers for decentralized storage networks have been other crypto networks. Decentralized Compute Networks Decentralized compute networks can act as AI model repositories, like Hugging Face (a centralized repository) for traditional AI, but also provide advantages of blockchain, like decentralization, data privacy and security, and incentive mechanisms for participants. They are also often called decentralized AI marketplaces. For example, the Akash Network is an open-source Supercloud that allows users to securely and efﬁciently buy and sell computing resources. It enables users to own their cloud infrastructure, deploy applications, and rent unused cloud resources. Akash operates as a decentralized public utility, utilizing a \"reverse auction\" system that often offers up to 85% lower prices than other cloud systems.2 The network is owned and managed by its community and built on resilient technologies like Kubernetes and Cosmos. Another example is Gensyn, which provides a decentralized marketplace where anyone can monetize spare GPU capacity for collective model training. This machine learning (ML) protocol rewards providers of idle compute capacity for pledging their compute time to the network and performing ML tasks while allowing developers to run AI algorithms on smaller data centers and other connected hardware and to pay on demand. Gensyn uses a novel cryptographic veriﬁcation system that, without the need for intermediaries, allows users to determine that machine learning work shared over the protocol has been ﬁnished correctly.3 The rise of AI drives demand for GPU graphics. The Render Network is a leading distributed rendering platform built by utilizing blockchain technology to aggregate idle GPUs worldwide and to provide a platform for creating images, videos, and other content. Compared with centralized cloud rendering services, Render Network has nearly unlimited computing power resources and features high computational efﬁciency, low cost, and good security. In the ﬁrst half of 2023, Render Network successfully processed over 4.6 million frames, providing a cost-effective solution compared to other rendering farms, with an average subscription cost of $20 per month.4 General-purpose compute networks Special-purpose compute networks General-purpose (GP) compute networks operate like Special-purpose (SP) compute networks are tailored to speciﬁc decentralized clouds, providing computing resources for various use cases: applications, including any machine learning workload. Model training – models are trained on large datasets to learn the patterns and relationships within the data. Fine-tuning – ML models can be further optimized using a smaller dataset to improve performance for a speciﬁc task. Model inference – the trained and ﬁne-tuned models are run to make predictions in response to user queries. 1) - https://cointelegraph.com/news/decentralized-ﬁle-storage-pricing-differentials-persist-despite-market-growth-report 2) - https://www.akash.network 3) - https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/06/11/blockchain-based-ai-compute-protocol-gensyn-closes-43m-series-a-funding-round-led-by-a16z/ 4) - the Render network TenSquared Capital, LLC | Proprietary 7", "metadata": {"source_file": "tensquared_com_10SQ-Web3+AI-Report-Feb'24.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/tensquared_com_10SQ-Web3+AI-Report-Feb'24.pdf", "page_number": 7, "chunk_id": "tensquared_com_10SQ-Web3+AI-Report-Feb'24_p7_c1", "title": "10SQ-Research-AI-Blockchain-14", "creationDate": "D:20240531123148-04'00'"}}
{"text": "Web3 and Artiﬁcial Intelligence: The State of Play | February 2024 Although sourcing the most performant GPUs (A100s and H100s) might be challenging, decentralized GPU networks could aggregate more accessible consumer-grade GPUs and create a valuable resource pool for ML developers. Decentralized compute networks are represented by general-purpose networks, operating like a decentralized cloud (e.g., Akash), and special-purpose decentralized compute networks, solving for speciﬁc use cases: model, ﬁne-tuning or inference (e.g., Gensyn, Gyza, Modulus Labs, ChainML). There has been a surge in special-purpose compute networks focused on inference capabilities recently. Estimates from Amazon and NVIDIA suggest that inference tasks account for 80% or more of AI computational demand. Inference tasks and ﬁne-tuning have lesser computational and bandwidth needs and seem more technically feasible on distributed networks in the short term than model training tasks.1 While general-purpose compute networks offer greater functionality, special-purpose compute networks are expected to gain adoption quicker in the short term as a network’s UX and performance can be more easily optimized for speciﬁc use cases. Decentralized compute networks provide accessible and cost-effective alternatives and computational liberty for everyone. Decentralized Data Set Creation Decentralized networks can incentivize data set creation by allowing individuals and smaller companies to derive ﬁnancial value from data set creation and sharing. Bittensor is one of the examples of such collaborative networks that incentivize knowledge production by rewarding participants for exchanging knowledge through their unique ML models. Bittensor’s blockchain is built using the Substrate framework, which is a modular framework that enables the creation of purpose-built blockchains. These purpose-built blockchains function through Bittensor's network, which allows them to interact and join into a singular computing infrastructure. Bagel Network is building a decentralized data platform where data providers can post ZK commitments to the on-chain marketplace, which will verify the integrity of the initial data set and track changes, similar to how GitHub works. The quality of the data sets will be determined by a combination of the free market and Bagel Network’s reputation mechanisms, backed by staked tokens.2 Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a technique that incorporates human feedback in the training process to ﬁne-tune a model. The need for such experts to provide feedback grows as the demand for domain-speciﬁc models increases. Token-incentivized RLHF decentralized networks can be used to ﬁne-tune models and reduce inaccurate or biased outputs. Decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePINs) incentivize individuals to gather real-world data, typically through sensors, or pay people bounties to participate. Historically, there has been an issue about where the data gets input and how trustworthy it is. DePINs offer a valuable means of collecting real-world data that can be utilized for model-training purposes. Examples of companies operating in the DePIN space include Helium (a decentralized wireless IoT network ), Dimo (a user-owned connected vehicle platform), and Hivemapper (a crowdsourced map built on data from vehicle dashcams). In December, Peaq, the blockchain for real-world applications, Robert Bosch GmbH, the world’s largest sensor manufacturer, and Fetch.ai, a Web3 AI company that provides infrastructure for smart, autonomous services, announced a new smart sensor, the Bosch XDK110 Rapid Prototyping Kit, which enables anyone to tap advanced Web3 and AI tech to earn rewards in crypto.

{"text": "Web3 and Artiﬁcial Intelligence: The State of Play | February 2024 Blockchain-based Solutions Improve Data Privacy In AI One of the key challenges for AI is that it can be used to violate privacy. AI systems require large amounts of data, which can be used for identity theft or cyberbullying. “Americans Are Terrified About AI: 80% Say AI Will Help Criminals Scam Them” – Forbes, August 20231 80% are concerned that their personal data is being used to train AI models. 77% are afraid AI tools will deepfake their voices or faces to commit fraud. 80% say AI has increased the likelihood that their personal data will be used in malicious ways by criminals or hacker collectives. 70% are worried that AI will be used by other nations in information warfare campaigns. Blockchain can be used to build encrypted networks. Combining AI and blockchain could enable more secure and efﬁcient cybersecurity systems. One of the solutions is self-sovereign identity when individuals have control over their identities and have autonomy to decide what information about their identity they want to share. Decentralized identity is a self-sovereign identity on-chain that enables the privacy and security of personal data. Some of the blockchain companies working on decentralized identity include WorldCoin, Spruce ID (developer of digital identity software), and Clique (an identity oracle connecting Web2 and Web3). Zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs enable easy access to identity and other data while maintaining privacy and property control. A ZK proof is a cryptographic protocol in which one party, the prover, can prove to another party, the veriﬁer, that a given statement is true, without revealing any additional information beyond the fact that the statement is true. ZK proofs are widely used to scale Ethereum with ZK rollups, build privacy-preserving applications, and identify primitives. Some of the companies working here include Aztec (a hybrid ZK rollup-based solution and encrypted apps), Semaphore (a generic, open-source privacy layer for Ethereum applications based on ZK-SNARKs), Sismo (a sovereign identity aggregator and crypto native single sign-on (SSO)). Homomorphic encryption enables complex computations on encrypted data without ﬁrst having to decrypt it. It is particularly useful for sensitive data, such as health care information. Fhenix Protocol is the ﬁrst conﬁdential blockchain powered by fully homomorphic encryption. Zama is a cryptography company building open-source homomorphic encryption solutions for blockchain and AI. Other encryption solutions used for decentralized networks include secured multi-party computations (MPC) and GAN cryptography. ZKML – Privacy-preserving Veriﬁcation For AI ZKMLs (zero-knowledge machine learning) is a new use case of blockchain for AI. ZKML enables secure and privacy-preserving veriﬁcation of machine learning models, improving trust and transparency in AI-based DApps and smart contracts. ZK proofs, and more speciﬁcally SNARKs, are most useful for the veriﬁcation of correct computation of machine learning on-chain. ZKSNARKs allow smart contracts to trustlessly query machine learning models and thus prove machine learning inference (prediction results).2 According to Aligned.co, the zero-knowledge proving market is projected to reach $75M in revenue in 2024, and has the potential to exceed $10Bn in revenue by 2030.3 ZK proofs will use 25% of the Ethereum block space in 2024 as the industry ramps up, growing to 90% by 2030. Web3 applications will require almost 90Bn ZK proofs in 2030, and Aligned.co expects the average market clearing price per proof to fall from $0.21 in 2024 to $0.12 by 2030. 1) - Source: https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2023/08/22/americans-are-terriﬁed-about-data-and-ai/ Note: The survey, which asked 1,002 American residents their opinions about AI and privacy, was conducted by an independent market research organization, Propeller Insights. 2) - Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge 3) - https://aligned.co/blog/10-billion-revenue-market-size-by-2030 TenSquared Capital, LLC | Proprietary 9", "metadata": {"source_file": "tensquared_com_10SQ-Web3+AI-Report-Feb'24.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/tensquared_com_10SQ-Web3+AI-Report-Feb'24.pdf", "page_number": 9, "chunk_id": "tensquared_com_10SQ-Web3+AI-Report-Feb'24_p9_c1", "title": "10SQ-Research-AI-Blockchain-14", "creationDate": "D:20240531123148-04'00'"}}
{"text": "Web3 and Artiﬁcial Intelligence: The State of Play | February 2024 ZKML: Use Cases Privacy-preserving model evaluation: ZKML can be utilized to demonstrate a machine learning model's accuracy without revealing its parameters, allowing users to verify the model's performance on a randomly chosen test set before purchasing it. Computational Integrity (validity ML): ZKML (SNARKs/STARKs) can be used to prove that computation has happened correctly. ZKML can also verify that the output is the product of a given model and input pair, allowing ML models to be run off-chain and save on on-chain costs.1 Modulus Labs is building trustless AI with ZKML proofs to make the technology more accessible for crypto protocols. Giza is helping Yearn (a DeFi yield aggregator protocol) to prove that some complex yield strategies that use ML are being correctly executed on-chain.1 Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) transparency: ZKML can be utilized to prove that a service provider is providing the model they say they are providing. Auditing and fraud detection: ZKML can be used for conducting audits without revealing sensitive data. Auditors could verify the accuracy and compliance of machine learning models without accessing the raw data, as well as smart contracts where ZK proofs could guarantee a contract ﬁts certain predetermined criteria. It is still too early for the current ZK systems to be able to prove current large language models (LLMs), but there has been some success in proving smaller models. According to the study by Modulus Labs \"Cost of Intelligence,” it is possible to create proofs for models with approx. 18 million parameters in about 50 seconds using a proving system like Polygon's plonky (chart). Another issue with ZK proving is its high cost, as it can be signiﬁcantly more expensive to use ZK proving for inferencing a model than just using AWS. As unit economics becomes increasingly important for on-chain services, service providers must balance the value of on-chain security with the cost of proof generation.2 There is also a question of the importance of 'technological' proof vs. just 'authority' proof; for example, do we always need a way to verify technologically that the computation is true/accurate?

{"text": "Web3 and Artiﬁcial Intelligence: The State of Play | February 2024 II. AI Applications for Web3 One of the most substantive impacts of AI in the crypto space is code-writing tools (ChatGPT, Github Co-pilot). AI co-pilots allow developers to write more code on more blockchain networks. For instance, if you know Solidity but need to code in Rust on Cosmos, then you can ask ChatGPT/Co-Pilot to transcribe the code. AI code-writing tools lower the barrier to entry in blockchain and allow developers to write much more quickly. AI can be integrated into blockchain either on the infrastructure level (smart contracts, protocols, Web3 security) or on the level of decentralized applications (DApps): Blockchain Infrastructure Level: AI can improve the core elements of blockchain infrastructure by creating intelligent smart contracts and intelligent consensus protocols that could make decisions based on dynamic on-chain data. It can also improve Web3 security by introducing AI-based detection systems. AI on-chain can also widen the design capabilities of crypto by allowing smart contracts to trustlessly query machine learning models, thereby giving rise to a new sector known as zero-knowledge machine learning (ZKML). Decentralized Application Level: Decentralized applications can use AI techniques on-chain to analyze blockchain data, identify patterns, and automate tasks and decision-making. AI can provide more personalized experiences based on analyzing user behavior and preferences. AI will particularly create value and transform decentralized ﬁnance (DeFi) applications, Web3 gaming, metaverse, and NFT space. Some industry experts predict that crypto will become the currency of choice for AI agents, and most payments will be made on-chain by AI agents on behalf of people. While LLMs are unable to get access to bank accounts, they can easily make payments using a funded crypto wallet and are well-suited to interacting with the logic of smart contracts and DeFi protocols. AI on-chain has the potential to revolutionize decentralized networks and applications and drive massive adoption of Web3. AI Applications for Web3 Infrastructure There are three main applications of AI to the core Web3 infrastructure: Intelligent Smart Contracts \"In general, use cases where the underlying mechanism AI-based smart contracts can make decisions based on real-time on-chain data and not only continues to be designed on static rules. This way, smart contracts will make more accurate and efﬁcient decisions. roughly as before, but the Intelligent smart contracts are a new area of research, with only a few early-stage individual players become AIs, startups working there. For example, Oraichain uses AI-based APIs to create infrastruc- allowing the mechanism to ture for intelligent smart contracts and next-generation decentralized applications. effectively operate at a much Intelligent Protocols more micro scale, are the Researchers and startups have been developing AI-based approaches to consensus most immediately promising mechanisms. Consensus mechanisms determine the security and scalability of blockchains. and the easiest to get right.\" For example, Velas is working on an Artiﬁcial Intelligent Delegated Proof-of-Stake. Inery – Vitalik Buterin, is developing a consensus mechanism to organize block validation based on uptime in co-founder of Ethereum the most efﬁcient order. Web3 Security AI-based Web3 security solutions can detect cyber attacks and improve the security of blockchain projects. Security is a real obstacle to crypto adoption. Cryptocurrency hackers stole $3.8Bn in 2022, according to Chainalysis. Most smart contract auditing and blockchain security ﬁrms have implemented AI-based security solutions, including such companies as Certik and Quanstamp. Hypernative, TestMachine, and CYVers are some of the new emerging startups focusing on AI-based solutions for Web3 security. Vitalik Buterin recently examined the use of AI as an actor, as an interface, as the rules themselves, and as an end objective in itself in his blog post.1 He believes that the use of AI as an actor within a protocol has the highest viability, while using AI as an interface to a protocol has high potential but carries some risk. Buterin noted that the most challenging use of cryptocurrency and AI to get right would be applications that try to create a single, decentralized, trusted AI for other applications to rely on. AI can make Web3 Infrastructure more intelligent, secure, and efﬁcient. This is a new area of research with a few promising early-stage startups building here. 1) - There’s too much trust in zero-knowledge tech by Misha Komarov, founder of =nil; Foundation, https://blockworks.co/news/theres-too-much-trust-in-zero-knowledge-tech TenSquared Capital, LLC | Proprietary 12", "metadata": {"source_file": "tensquared_com_10SQ-Web3+AI-Report-Feb'24.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/tensquared_com_10SQ-Web3+AI-Report-Feb'24.pdf", "page_number": 12, "chunk_id": "tensquared_com_10SQ-Web3+AI-Report-Feb'24_p12_c1", "title": "10SQ-Research-AI-Blockchain-14", "creationDate": "D:20240531123148-04'00'"}}

Some centralized exchanges, like Binance and others, are already using AI for trade monitoring. AI-powered trading strategies and trading bots: By leveraging AI-powered trading bots and predictive analytics, traders can optimize their trading decisions and capitalize on market trends and opportunities. For example, 3Commas operates a cryptocurrency trading bot platform to help traders automate their trading strategies. Predictive analytics: AI can analyze market conditions in real-time and assist DeFi platforms in making more informed risk decisions. For example, Numerai's blockchain-based hedge fund utilizes artiﬁcial intelligence and crowdsourced stock market predictions to optimize the platform's investing approach. The company functions as a platform disseminating encrypted ﬁnancial data sets to a global network of 5.5k data scientists who utilize machine learning to develop predictive models for signaling stock market trades.1 Data scientists can gain tokens by building models that perform well on the data sets provided by Numerai or lose tokens if their stock predictions underperform.

Besides new use cases, AI technology could signiﬁcantly affect existing companies operating in the digital asset ecosystem (DAE). McKinsey estimates that the economic effect on the value of incremental increases in productivity for existing companies (35-70%) will exceed the incremental impact of new AI use cases (15-40%).1 Approximately 40% of surveyed enterprises already consider building enterprise-speciﬁc language models internally. AI could improve the existing DAE companies’ business models in the following ways: Reduce costs: AI can add value by automating existing workﬂows or repetitive tasks and capturing and acting on real-time information. Across all industries, about three-quarters of the value from generative AI would emerge from four areas of business: customer operations, marketing and sales, software engineering, and research and development, according to McKinsey. This is also true for DAE companies. Increase revenue: AI enables companies to better upsell/cross-sell products, increase customer retention, expand growth from new product releases, charge premiums for AI-integrated services, increase price over time as the value proposition and stickiness of existing products grow with the integration of AI. Web3 businesses operating in ﬁnancial services, infrasrtucture, and data & forensics are well-positioned to use AI to increase revenue.

Casper Labs commissioned Zogby Analytics to conduct an online survey of 608 IT decision-makers in six countries: the US, the UK, China, Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. Compatibility issues: AI relies on data stored and processed in centralized servers or cloud platforms, while blockchain is a decentralized node network that stores and veriﬁes transactions in encrypted blocks. Complexity integrating with existing systems is by far the most prevalent concern about implementing blockchain and AI technology. Accessibility issues: While blockchain often lacks intuitive interfaces and clear applications for easy adoption by everyday users, AI was able to package complex operations into user-friendly applications, for example, ChatGPT, Siri, and Alexa. To achieve levels of adoption similar to AI, blockchain may need to ﬁnd ways to simplify user interactions. Governance issues: AI and blockchain have different models of governance, which can affect how they are regulated and controlled. AI is often governed by centralized authorities, such as developers, owners, or regulators, who can inﬂuence its behavior, goals, and outcomes. Blockchain, in contrast, is governed by decentralized protocols, such as consensus rules, incentives, or voting mechanisms, which the network participants enforce. The challenge lies in balancing pure decentralization with delivering performant, real-world systems. ZK technology issues: Zero-knowledge (ZK) technology, in a Web3 context, is still fairly new. Developers are actively addressing ZK tech’s current issues, but the innovative nature of the space means that they are often conceptualizing faster than they can build.1 ZK technology space has also gotten to a point where it risks overcomplicating itself. There is a growing knowledge gap between ZK builders and Web3 users. Other issues facing ZK tech development include optimizing time-to-market without compromising on the integrity of projects. ZK proofs and circuits currently lack accessibility, because developers need to learn domain-speciﬁc languages (DSLs) to enable further proving of these computations. This is a problem because only a handful of people globally have ﬁrsthand knowledge of DSLs and cryptography. AI and blockchain are currently at different acceptance levels, but they are not incompatible. Integrating these two technologies can bring about tremendous synergies. 1) - There’s too much trust in zero-knowledge tech by Misha Komarov, founder of =nil; Foundation, https://blockworks.co/news/theres-too-much-trust-in-zero-knowledge-tech TenSquared Capital, LLC | Proprietary 21", "metadata": {"source_file": "tensquared_com_10SQ-Web3+AI-Report-Feb'24.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/tensquared_com_10SQ-Web3+AI-Report-Feb'24.pdf", "page_number": 21, "chunk_id": "tensquared_com_10SQ-Web3+AI-Report-Feb'24_p21_c1", "title": "10SQ-Research-AI-Blockchain-14", "creationDate": "D:20240531123148-04'00'"}}
