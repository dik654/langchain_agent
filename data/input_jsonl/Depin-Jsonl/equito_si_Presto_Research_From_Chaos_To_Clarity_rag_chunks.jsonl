Best & Worst Performers Asset prices in well-functioning markets distills the collective wisdom of the crowd into a dynamic signal, capturing narratives, themes, and trends. Reviewing the best and worst performers in a thriving marketplace is, therefore, an insightful way to reflect on the past. That’s exactly what we’ve done in the analysis below. A few points to note on our methodology. First, we have limited our universe to three centralized exchanges, namely Binance, Bybit, and OKX. Second, we further broke down the universe into ‘New Listing (i.e. listed in 2024)’ and ‘Incumbent (i.e. listed in 2023 or before).’ Third, from each of these six sub-universes, we screened for five best and worst performers. The full results are summarized below Fig. 2, 3. It should be noted that this approach does not capture trends in major assets like BTC or ETH, as smaller market-cap assets tend to exhibit more extreme performances. Instead, the analysis aims to uncover sector themes or individual projects that may otherwise be overlooked. With this caveat in mind, our findings point to three key trends: ‘VC Coin’ underperformance, the memecoin craze, the RWA buzz, and the rise of DEXs.

The mere introduction of a newly minted asset, no matter how shiny it appears or how well-backed it is by flashy VC Without getting into the weeds on the project’s prospects, its names, no longer guarantees that retail investors will blindly chase remarkable performance underscores the market’s burgeoning it. Instead, it signals that the strategy of exploiting informationally enthusiasm for the RWA theme – and suggests that retail investors see disadvantaged retail investors as exit liquidity on centralized exchanges its potential as rivaling, if not surpassing, the allure of memecoins. is losing its effectiveness. Such tactics, a cheap shot often employed by sub-par VCs, have persisted for far too long. More on this later under “2.2.5. Is FDV a Meme?” 2.1.2. The Memecoin Craze As retail investors increasingly perceive VC coins to be \"rigged\" against them, many have flocked to what they consider a more level playing field: memecoins. This shift has been the main driver of the unprecedented boom in the memecoin sector. The prominence of memecoins across all six tables of top performers underscores their impact. This trend can be seen as a reflex to the first point above, because memecoins are typically characterized by low inflation and/or high float – traits that directly oppose those of VC coins. Regardless of whether memecoins are truly \"fair,\" this narrative has been powerful enough to mobilize retail investors en masse in a way no other narrative could. As a result, memecoins have solidified their position as the defining feature of the 2024 crypto market.

This may seem counterintuitive, to be pertinent throughout the year. In this section, we reflect on five given that new listings are historically associated with the start of research articles that have particularly aged well. hype cycles.

Post-election analysis confirms this view - the actual premium, calculated using realised volatility, came in at around 4.8%, In early October, we published an analysis of Bitcoin's implied election significantly below what was implied a month before the election. Our premium, estimating that options markets were pricing in an additional recommended trade structure (3x short 55k/72k 08Nov24 strangle 8% daily volatility around the November 2024 U.S. presidential election. versus 1x long 65k/75k 28Mar25 strangle) has performed well, with the Our analysis suggested this premium was likely overstated, leading us short leg realising a 0.1653 BTC loss at expiry while the long position to propose a calendar strangle strategy to short the election premium has gained 0.4145 BTC as of December 2nd, generating a net profit of whilst longing longer-dated March volatility in a vega-neutral manner. 0.2492 BTC. Recent market developments suggest taking profits on this position. First, one of our key justifications for the March 2025 long volatility Figure 9 Reading The Tea Leaves position was the high number of expected Fed rate cuts that quarter. However, post-election macro forecasts under Trump's presidency have led to a significant repricing of rate expectations, with the Z4H5 Fed Funds spread now at -20bps versus -42.5bps in October. Second, the introduction of $IBIT options on November 19th introduces structural changes that could dampen volatility. As noted by Arbelos’ Joshua Lim, traditional finance options markets often suppress volatility through structured product supply, with even a modest $5b in $IBIT-linked notes representing a quarter of current Deribit open interest. Academic research supports this view - Arkorful et al. (2020) documented how the introduction of SSE 50ETF options in Chinese markets significantly decreased underlying volatility through improved information flow and market efficiency, an effect that could be even more pronounced in Bitcoin given its now global nature and sophisticated market-making infrastructure that surrounds it.

With Wall Street slowly but surely embracing the asset class and the public urgency to resolve fiscal deficits, the bill may gain more momentum in the right political environment. Figure 10 ‘Louisiana Purchase Moment’ Even if passage is years away, the submission of the bill now means the conversation will begin, lawmakers will seek education, and other governments will have a benchmark to follow.

Investors are now more informed about the long-term effects of such practices, recognizing that their holdings are likely to face consistent dilution over Figure 11 Ahead of The Curve the next three to four years. One key observation from the report remains highly relevant today: the role of tokenomics in fueling the memecoin rally. While memecoins were active in early 2024, their prominence at the time pales in comparison to the frenzy we see now. Platforms like pump.fun, initially serving as launchpads for memecoins, have evolved into hubs for general project launches. We are now seeing these tokenomic trends extend to projects beyond memecoins. This trend highlights that memecoin rallies aren’t merely speculative bubbles—they’re deeply influenced by tokenomic structures. As noted in the report: On this topic, the recent memecoin rally ironically can serve as a model. Unlike cryptocurrencies in other sectors that often suffer from substantial unlocks—for example, those with an initial circulating supply of 10%—most memecoins have 100% unlocked at launch, thus avoiding continuous dilution. While one cannot attribute memecoin rallies solely to their tokenomics, it undoubtedly plays a significant role in their appeal and sustained interest. In this context, the \"barbell structure\" trade has proven remarkably Source: Presto Research prescient.

As of now, Cap 3 of Phase 1 is about to commence (10Dec24), while the actual mainnet activation and TGE launch are set to occur during the Phase 2 update in February 2025. BTC is undoubtedly the cryptocurrency with the most overwhelmingly dominant market cap ($1.89T as of December 2024) among all existing assets. It will be crucial to observe how much BTC Babylon can accumulate by early next year, and how significantly its ecosystem will grow based on that foundation. Source: Presto Research On Sep 3rd, we published a report on Babylon, a Bitcoin staking protocol. While protocols for staking Bitcoin in a wrapped form through bridging have existed, Babylon stands out due to its technical novelty as a “remote staking protocol.” Babylon allows Bitcoin staking without requiring BTC to be wrapped onto another chain or transferring private keys to anyone, ensuring a self-custodial approach. As a two-sided marketplace, Babylon acts as a bridge that puts Bitcoin to work by staking it to enhance the security of small-market- cap PoS chains. Babylon’s remote staking protocol offers robust security guarantees to both the consumer chains (PoS chains) and the provider Bitcoin holders, leveraging its innovative implementation of Timestamping Protocols, Finality Gadgets, and Bond Contracts.
