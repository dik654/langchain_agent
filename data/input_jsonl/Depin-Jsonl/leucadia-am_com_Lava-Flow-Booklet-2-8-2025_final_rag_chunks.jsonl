{"text": "RISK FACTORS REGARDING DIGITAL ASSETS DIGITAL ASSETS Digital Assets are loosely regulated and there is no central marketplace for currency exchange. Supply is determined by a computer code, not by a central bank, and prices can be extremely volatile. Digital Asset exchanges have been closed due to fraud, failure, or security breaches. Any of the Fund’s funds that reside on an exchange that shuts down may be lost. Several factors may affect the price of Digital Assets, including, but not limited to: supply and demand, investors’ expectations with respect to the rate of inflation, interest rates, currency exchange rates or future regulatory measures (if any) that restrict the trading of Digital Assets or the use of Digital Assets as a form of payment. There is no assurance that Digital Assets will maintain their long-term value in terms of purchasing power in the future, or that acceptance of Digital Asset payments by mainstream retail merchants and commercial businesses will grow. Digital Assets are created, issued, transmitted, and stored according to protocols run by computers in the Digital Asset network. It is possible these protocols have undiscovered flaws which could result in the loss of some or all assets held by the Fund. There may also be network scale attacks against these protocols which result in the loss of some or all of assets held by the Fund. Some assets held by the Fund may be created, issued, or transmitted using experimental cryptography which could have underlying flaws. Advancements in quantum computing could break the cryptographic rules of protocols which support the assets held by the Fund. The Fund makes no guarantees about the reliability of the cryptography used to create, issue, or transmit assets held by the Fund. DIGITAL ASSETS EXCHANGES The Fund expects to mainly use Coinbase, Inc., (“Coinbase”) as the Fund’s primary Digital Assets exchange but may use other Digital Asset Exchanges in its sole discretion. While Coinbase is a registered broker-dealer, Digital Assets, in general, are relatively new and largely unregulated and may therefore be more exposed to theft, fraud and failure than established, regulated exchanges for other products. In general, Digital Asset exchanges may be start-up businesses with limited operating history and limited publicly available financial information. Exchanges generally require cash to be deposited in advance in order to purchase Digital Assets, and no assurance can be given that those deposit funds can be recovered. Additionally, upon sale of a Digital Asset, cash proceeds may not be received from the exchange for several business days. The participation in exchanges requires users to take on credit risk by transferring Digital Assets from a personal account to a third-party's account. The Fund will take credit risk of an exchange every time it transacts (including Coinbase). Digital Asset exchanges may impose daily, weekly, monthly, or customer-specific transaction or distribution limits or suspend withdrawals entirely, rendering the exchange of Digital Assets for fiat currency difficult or impossible. Additionally, Digital Asset prices and valuations on Digital Asset exchanges have been volatile and subject to influence by many factors including the levels of liquidity on exchanges and operational interruptions and disruptions. The prices and valuation of Digital Assets remain subject to any volatility experienced by Digital Asset exchanges, and any such volatility can adversely affect an investment in the Fund. Digital Asset exchanges are appealing targets for cybercrime, hackers, and malware. It is possible that while engaging in transactions with various Digital Asset exchanges located throughout the world, any such exchange may cease operations due to theft, fraud, security breach, liquidity issues, or government investigation. In addition, banks may refuse to process wire transfers to or from exchanges. Over the past several years, many exchanges have, indeed, closed due to fraud, theft (e.g., Mt. Gox voluntarily shutting down because it was unable to account for over 850,000 Bitcoin), government or regulatory involvement, failure or security breaches (e.g., the voluntary temporary suspensions by Mt. Gox of cash withdrawals due to distributed denial of service attacks by malware and/or hackers), or banking issues (e.g., the loss of Tradehill’s banking privileges at Internet Archive Federal Credit Union). Any financial, security or operational difficulties experienced by such exchanges may result in an inability of the Fund to recover money or Digital Assets being held by the exchange, or to pay investors upon withdrawal. Further, the Fund may be unable to recover Digital Assets awaiting transmission into or out of the Fund, all of which could adversely affect an investment in the Fund. Additionally, to the extent that the Digital Asset exchanges representing a substantial portion of the volume in Digital Asset trading are involved in fraud or experience security failures or other operational issues, such Digital Asset exchanges' failures may result in loss or less favorable prices of Digital Assets, or may adversely affect the Fund, its operations and investments, or the Limited Partners. RISKS OF BUYING OR SELLING DIGITAL ASSETS The Fund may transact with private buyers or sellers or virtual currency exchanges. The Fund will take on credit risk every time it purchases or sells digital currency or Digital Assets, and its contractual rights with respect to such transactions may be limited. Although the Fund’s transfers of Digital Assets or cash will be made to or from a counterparty which the Investment Manager believes is trustworthy, it is possible that, through computer or human error, or through theft or criminal action, the Fund’s Digital Assets or cash could be transferred in incorrect amounts or to unauthorized third parties. To the extent that the Fund is unable to seek a corrective transaction with such third party or is incapable of identifying the third party which has received it, the Fund may incur a loss. Tephra may at any time adjust, increase, decrease or eliminate any of the targets, depending on, among other things, conditions and trends, general economic conditions and changes in Tephra’s investment philosophy, strategy and expectations regarding the focus, techniques and activities of its strategy. Fund’s Digital Assets or cash (through error or theft), the Fund will be unable to recover incorrectly transferred Digital Assets or cash, and such losses will negatively impact the Fund.", "metadata": {"source_file": "leucadia-am_com_Lava-Flow-Booklet-2-8-2025_final.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/leucadia-am_com_Lava-Flow-Booklet-2-8-2025_final.pdf", "page_number": 103, "chunk_id": "leucadia-am_com_Lava-Flow-Booklet-2-8-2025_final_p103_c1", "title": "PowerPoint Presentation", "author": "Gilbert Arevalo", "creationDate": "D:20250208150920-05'00'"}}
{"text": "RISK FACTORS REGARDING DIGITAL ASSETS (CONTINUED) CUSTODY OF FUND ASSETS With respect to Digital Assets, the Investment Manager primarily maintains custody of the Fund’s Digital Assets with Fidelity Digital Assets Services and Coinbase, however the General Partner, at its sole discretion and without prior notice to Limited Partners, may select other custodians in the future. Fidelity Digital Asset Services, LLC is a New York State-chartered limited liability trust company. Coinbase is a registered broker-dealer. The Investment Manager may also maintain custody of the Fund’s Digital Assets with other third-party custodians selected by the Investment Manager, including the use of multiparty computation custodians or on or within “hot wallets” on exchanges. The Investment Manager may also utilize proprietary storage methods developed by the General Partner or Investment Manager. Digital Asset exchanges may also require the Investment Manager to provide control of the private keys when the exchange is utilized by the Fund. The Investment Manager may not be able to obtain control of the private keys generated by the exchanges utilized by the Fund, because each exchange may use different methodologies and security systems. The General Partner and Investment Manager are not liable to the Fund or to Limited Partners for the failure or penetration of the security system absent gross negligence, fraud or criminal behavior. SYSTEMS AND OPERATIONAL RISK The Fund’s investment strategy relies extensively on computer programs and systems to trade, clear, and settle Digital Assets transactions, to evaluate certain Digital Assets based on real-time trading information, to monitor its portfolio and net capital, and to generate risk management and other reports that are critical to oversight of account activities. In addition, certain of the General Partner’s and Investment Manager’s operations interface with or depend on systems operated by third parties, including its prime brokers and market counterparties and their sub-custodians and other service providers, and the General Partner and Investment Manager may not be in a position to verify the risks or reliability of such third-party systems. These programs or systems may be subject to certain defects, failures, or interruptions, including, but not limited to, those caused by worms, viruses and power failures. Any such defect or failure could have a material adverse effect on the Fund’s portfolio. COMPUTER MALWARE, VIRUSES, BUGS, ETC. Computer malware, viruses, and computer hacking and phishing attacks have become more prevalent in the industries in which the Digital Assets exchanges (including Coinbase) operate and may occur on Coinbase’s or other Digital Assets exchanges’ systems or technologies. Though it is difficult to determine what, if any, harm may directly result from any specific interruption or attack, any failure to maintain performance, reliability, security, and availability of Coinbase’s, or other Digital Asset exchanges’ products and technical infrastructure may harm such Coinbase’s, or Digital Asset exchanges’ reputations, their ability to retain existing users and attract new users, and their results of operations. Digital Assets exchange (including Coinbase) products and internal systems generally rely on software that is highly technical and complex, and such internal systems depend on the ability of such software to store, retrieve, process, and manage immense amounts of data. Such software may now or in the future contain undetected errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities. Some errors may only be discovered after the code has been released for external or internal use. Errors or other design defects within such software may result in a negative experience for users and marketers who use Coinbase, or other exchange products, delay product introductions or enhancements, or result in measurement or billing errors. Any errors, bugs, or defects discovered in Coinbase’s, or another Digital Asset exchange’s software could result in damage to Coinbase, or such other Digital Asset exchanges’ reputations, loss of users, loss of revenue, or liability for damages, any of which could adversely affect such exchanges and could result in significant losses. HIGHLY VOLATILE MARKETS The prices of Digital Assets in which the Fund may invest can be highly volatile. Price movements of Digital Assets in which the Fund’s assets may be invested are influenced by, among other things, interest rates, changing supply and demand relationships, trade, fiscal, monetary and exchange control programs and policies of governments, and national and international political and economic events and policies. The Fund is subject to the risk of failure of any of the centralized exchanges on which their positions trade. HIGH RISK INVESTMENTS While investments in Digital Assets offer the opportunity for significant capital gains, such investments involve a high degree of business, financial, technological and regulatory risk, which can result in substantial losses. Moreover, the Fund’s portfolio may include investments particularly subject to increased risk because they are in Digital Assets at an early stage of development. As a result, the Fund may experience substantial volatility and potential for loss. The Investment Manager believes that its investment program and research techniques moderate this risk through a careful selection of Digital Assets and other financial instruments. However, no guarantee or representation is made that the program will be successful.", "metadata": {"source_file": "leucadia-am_com_Lava-Flow-Booklet-2-8-2025_final.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/leucadia-am_com_Lava-Flow-Booklet-2-8-2025_final.pdf", "page_number": 104, "chunk_id": "leucadia-am_com_Lava-Flow-Booklet-2-8-2025_final_p104_c1", "title": "PowerPoint Presentation", "author": "Gilbert Arevalo", "creationDate": "D:20250208150920-05'00'"}}
