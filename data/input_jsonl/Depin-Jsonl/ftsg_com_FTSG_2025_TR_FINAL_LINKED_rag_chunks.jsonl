{"text": "LETTER FROM AMY WEBB EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Beyond the Rubicon: Navigating Humanity’s Point of No Return In the past year, humanity crossed multiple points of no return. This didn’t happen gradually, but in sudden, irreversible leaps that have fundamentally altered the trajectory of civilization. We’ve moved beyond our mental models, beyond biological constraints, beyond social norms—into territory we can neither fully explain nor comprehend. Just as the first telescopes revealed the vastness of space, today’s science and tech advances are revealing how much we don’t understand about our own potential. Yes, AI has made daily headlines, but it’s just one piece of a larger transformation. Two other areas of technology—advanced sensors and biotechnology—are quietly advancing and converging as they evolve. That convergence is creating what we call “living intelligence:” systems that sense, learn, adapt, and evolve. Living intelligence will drive an exponential cycle of innovation, acting as an accelerant for technologies that had previously stalled, from quantum computing to robotics. For some organizations, this will unlock unprecedented opportunities in everything from drug discovery to energy production to financial Amy Webb services. For others, it will trigger overwhelming disorientation as they struggle to adapt to change occurring faster than their ability to process it. The gap between leaders and laggards will widen dramatically, not over decades, but months.Chief Executive Officer FTSG Let me be clear: The decisions we make in the next five years will determine the long-term fate of human civilization. This isn’t hyperbole— it’s the sobering conclusion drawn from our best available data. The convergence of tech isn’t just changing how we work or live; it’s changing what it means to be human. We’re building systems that can reprogram biology, reshape matter at the atomic level, and process information in ways that defy classical physics. The implications extend far beyond quarterly earnings or market share. This report isn’t designed to predict the future. Its purpose is to help you navigate it. While individual trends aren’t useful in isolation, when combined with scenario planning and strategic foresight, they become powerful tools for decision-making. In a world that has moved beyond traditional boundaries, the goal isn’t to get the future right—it’s to get your decisions right in the present. Welcome to the beyond.

{"text": "LETTER FROM THE AUTHORS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AI’s bleeding edge now changes by the hour, not year. What next? AI is moving at breakneck speed, reshaping industries, workflows, and everyday life faster than we can document. On the day we wrote this, people were still breathlessly marveling at China’s DeepSeek, which achieved OpenAI’s top-tier performance with a fraction of the usual price tag and computing power—challenging everything we thought we knew about what it takes to build advanced AI. Hours later, researchers at Stanford and the University of Washington debuted yet another new model, s1, which outperformed both Amy Webb Sam Jordan DeepSeek’s R1 and OpenAI’s o1 reasoning models using even fewer resources. Chief Executive Officer Technology & Computing Lead That’s the nature of AI right now: What’s bleeding-edge today might be old news … later today. Here’s what we know for certain. Last year, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman met with sovereign wealth fund managers and investors, hoping to raise up to $7 trillion for an AI chip company. In January 2025, Stargate, a newly formed joint venture between OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank, said it would raise $500 billion for chips, AI data centers, and their massive power requirements. Not to be outdone, Microsoft, Meta, and Google have each announced plans to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in AI infrastructure.

{"text": "STATE OF PLAY ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE Artificial intelligence will It’s no secret that AI’s landscape has transformed dramatically since we wrote the State of Play section last year. GPT-4 set early benchmarks with its multimodal capabilities and professional-level performance, but since then, Google DeepMind’s Gemini Ultra raised thefundamentally rewire dynamics and competitive bar further, exceeding GPT-4 on most benchmarks. The field has split between proprietary and open-source approaches. Meta’s release of Llamafrontiers in 2025. 2 sparked an open-source revolution, with developers rapidly fine-tuning variants that rival larger commercial models. This success prompted even OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman to admit that the company might have been “on the wrong side of history” regarding closed systems. Cloud partnerships have become crucial. Microsoft bet big on OpenAI ($10B), while Amazon and Google split their support for Anthropic ($4B and $2B respectively). These alliances provide AI companies with massive compute power while securing cloud providers’ positions in the AI race. However, this concentration of resources raises concerns about market consolidation. China has emerged as a formidable AI power. Baidu’s Ernie 4.0 claims GPT-4-level performance, while Alibaba released more than 100 open-source models under Qwen 2.5. ByteDance’s Doubao chatbot gained significant market share. Also making huge strides are Zhipu AI, MiniMax, Baichuan Intelligence, Moonshot, StepFun, and 01.AI—collectively known as the country’s “Six Little Tigers.” Despite US chip restrictions, Chinese firms are adapting with domestic alternatives like Huawei’s Ascend and Baidu’s Kunlun chips. Investment has exploded, with more than $22 billion flowing to generative AI startups last year alone, representing nearly half of all AI funding. Traditional VCs are competing with tech giants throwing billions at AI, driving valuations skyward. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

In major economies—the United States, China, and the European Union—policymakers are advancing distinct approaches to govern AI. These regulatory developments carry significant geopolitical and economic implications, and they pose potential constraints on innovation if miscalibrated.

{"text": "ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE POLICY & REGULATION Brazil: On the Path to AI Legislation Brazil is an important emerging market to watch in AI policy. The country is in the process of formulating its first AI-specific law, drawing inspiration from global frameworks. In late 2022, a special commission of the Brazilian Senate released a draft AI regulation bill. The proposal mirrors the EU’s approach in key ways: It defines AI systems in a similar fashion and establishes risk-based categories (prohibited, high-risk, etc.) As of this report’s writing, the legislation has not been enacted and is still undergoing debate and revision in the Brazilian Congress​. Brazilian policymakers are weighing how strict the final law should be, given the country’s need to both protect citizens and encourage tech innovation. In the interim, Brazil relies on its general laws (such as the data protection law LGPD and consumer protection code) and sectoral regulations. For CEOs, Brazil’s trajectory suggests a coming regulatory shift. Companies operating there should engage with the policy process (through industry associations providing input on the bill) and begin aligning their AI systems with the likely requirements—particularly around transparency, fairness, and human oversight—that Brazil appears poised to adopt. Given that Brazil’s draft draws on the EU model, compliance practices developed for Europe could offer a blueprint for Brazil as well. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE POLICY & REGULATION United Arab Emirates: Balancing Innovation with Guidelines The UAE has taken a proactive yet business-friendly approach to AI policy, consistent with its ambition to be a global technology hub. Instead of a single omnibus AI law, the government has rolled out a series of strategies, guidelines, and targeted regulations to govern AI. On a national level, the UAE was one of the first countries to appoint a Minister of State for AI, which it did in 2017, and issue a national AI strategy. The country’s National AI Strategy 2031, released in 2018, outlines a vision for AI in various sectors and emphasizes ethics and societal benefits. Building on this, the country published ethical guidelines for AI (e.g., the UAE AI Ethics Principles and Toolkit in 2019 under the Dubai Smart City initiative) to steer developers toward responsible practices regarding fairness, transparency, and accountability. These guidelines are not mandatory law but have been adopted within government projects and encouraged in the private sector. The UAE’s approach reflects a smart geopolitical strategy to attract AI talent and investment by offering a relatively light-touch regulatory environment while still aligning with international best practices. Economically, the leadership sees AI as a driver of diversification and is invest- ing heavily in AI startups and research labs—like the recently-established Mohamed Bin Zayed University of AI—along with public-private partnerships. Companies in the UAE can leverage government support for AI trials, but they should also heed the issued guidelines to ensure their AI solutions meet expected ethical standards. Over the next few years, the UAE is likely to for- malize more sector-specific rules, like for AI-transport (drones, autonomous vehicles, eVTOLs). For CEOs, active engagement with UAE regulators and adherence to the voluntary codes will be important. The UAE demonstrates that soft law and innovation incentives can go hand-in-hand in shaping AI governance, a model that other countries in the Middle East may follow. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "LETTER FROM THE AUTHOR WEB3 If you’re focused on NFTs, you’re missing the point of Web3. For years, Web3 has been synonymous with speculation. NFTs, meme coins, and get-rich-quick schemes have shaped the public narrative, making it easy to dismiss as hype. But beneath the noise, something much more fundamental is taking shape—a structural shift in how we secure, verify, and exchange value in the digital world. The internet as we know it was never designed to handle the weight of the global economy. Our systems— financial, legal, and informational—are layered on top of fragile, trust-based networks prone to breaches, fraud, and inefficiency. Every day, companies and individuals place blind faith in intermediaries to maintain records, safeguard assets, and act in good faith. And every day, we see examples of why that faith is misplaced. Web3 is not just about decentralization for the sake of it, nor is it a rebellion against institutions. It is about Melanie Subin infrastructure—about replacing trust with cryptographic certainty, about reducing friction and risk in an Managing Director increasingly volatile digital landscape. Enterprises, governments, and industries that seem slow to adopt blockchain-based solutions aren’t rejecting the technology itself; they are struggling with the human reality of change. Adoption is not just a technical hurdle—it is a cultural one. Yet, this shift to a Web3-powered world is inevitable. It won’t come in the form of a single disruptive moment, but as a slow and necessary evolution as blockchain becomes invisible, seamlessly embedded into the fabric of digital commerce, identity, and security. From financial services to supply chains, health care to intellectual property, the most critical sectors will depend on these systems not because they are new, but because they are better. The challenge ahead is not about convincing people to “believe in crypto.” It is about building the systems that make trust obsolete—where integrity is the default and risk is minimized by design. This report is not about hype. It is about what comes next. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

The Web3 ecosystem is rapidly evolving, with key developments in several strategic areas. Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are emerging as novel governance structures, challenging traditional corporate models. The tokenization of real-world assets is opening new avenues for fractional ownership and liquidity in previously illiquid markets. Meanwhile, the metaverse concept is gaining traction, blurring the lines between physical and digital realms, and creating immersive experiences that are reshaping entertainment, education, and commerce. These trends are compelling businesses to reevaluate their digital strategies and explore how Web3 technologies can enhance their competitive edge. However, the path to Web3 adoption is not without challenges. Regulatory uncertainty remains a significant hurdle, with governments worldwide grappling with how to oversee this decentralized landscape. Scalability and interoperability issues persist, though Layer-2 solutions and cross- chain protocols are making strides in addressing these concerns. User experience and accessibility continue to be pain points, hindering mass adoption. For business leaders, the key to navigating this landscape lies in strategic experimentation, fostering partnerships within the Web3 ecosystem, and staying agile in response to rapid technological advancements and shifting regulatory landscapes. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "SCENARIO WEB3 SCENARIO YEAR 2035 A RETROSPECTIVE FROM THE GLOBAL BUSINESS REVIEW Ten years ago, Web3 was still largely seen as a fringe technology, synonymous with volatile cryptocurrencies and niche use cases. Today, it’s the bedrock of global commerce, securely and efficiently powering operations across countless industries. The transformation wasn’t a revolution, but a gradual integration, much like how the internet itself became an indispensable utility. By now, in 2035, the “blockchain” buzzword has faded, replaced by the quiet hum of trust-minimized systems operating seamlessly in the background. Regulations, carefully balanced to encourage innovation while protecting consumers, have fostered mainstream adoption. International standards and interoperability protocols, spearheaded by organizations like a revamped SWIFT and industry consortiums, allow for seamless data and asset transfer across different blockchain networks and legacy systems. This cross-chain operability has been a game changer for global supply chains. Consider the luxury goods industry: Every diamond, handbag, and bottle of wine is digitally tracked from origin to point of sale, guaranteeing authenticity and ethical sourcing thanks to systems like De Beers’ Tracr platform. Consumers can instantly verify a product’s provenance, combating counterfeiting and bolstering brand trust. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "SCENARIO • A RETROSPECTIVE FROM THE GLOBAL BUSINESS REVIEW WEB3 The financial services sector has been completely transformed. Tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) is ubiquitous. Major asset managers like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton offer tokenized versions of everything from government bonds to real estate. These digital assets trade 24/7 on decentralized exchanges, offering unprecedented liquidity and fractional ownership opportunities. AI-powered trading platforms, like the descendants of SynFutures’ Synthia, execute complex strategies with unparalleled efficiency and transparency, all immutably recorded on-chain. Cross-border payments are instantaneous and nearly frictionless, powered by stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) operating on interoperable blockchain networks. Of course, with increased integration comes increased risk. AI-powered cyberattacks are a constant threat, necessitating advanced security measures. Biometric authentication is standard, but sophisticated deepfakes and AI-generated phishing scams require constant vigilance. The industry has responded with AI-driven security solutions that analyze blockchain transactions in real-time, detecting and mitigating threats before they can cause damage. Zero-knowledge proofs are also becoming commonplace, allowing businesses to verify data without revealing sensitive information, further enhancing privacy and security. Web3’s evolution has not only improved efficiency and security but has also fostered new models of collaboration and funding. Sustainable public goods, like open-source software and critical infrastructure, are increasingly funded through retroactive funding mechanisms and quadratic funding platforms like Gitcoin. DAOs have become sophisticated governance tools, empowering communities to collectively manage resources and make decisions transparently. The Web3 of 2035 is not the utopian dream of decentralization maximalists, but a pragmatic and powerful infrastructure layer woven into the fabric of global commerce. Businesses that embraced this evolution early on are now reaping the rewards: increased efficiency, reduced risk, enhanced transparency, and closer relationships with their customers. Those who hesitated are now playing catch-up in a world where cryptographic certainty is the new normal. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

Consider the logistics industry: by 2035, AI-powered supply chain management systems leverage blockchain technology to track goods from origin to destination with unparalleled transparency and efficiency. This has not only reduced fraud and waste but has also enabled businesses to respond more quickly and effectively to disruptions in the supply chain. Or, consider the financial services sector: AI-driven trading platforms execute complex strategies on decentralized exchanges, providing investors with access to new asset classes and investment opportunities while maintaining a transparent and auditable record of all transactions. The successful integration of Web3 technologies required more than just technical expertise; it demanded a new mindset, a willingness to experiment, and a commitment to continuous learning. Visionary CTOs invested in training and development programs to equip their teams with the skills and knowledge they needed to thrive in this rapidly evolving landscape. They fostered a culture of innovation, encouraging their teams to explore new use cases for blockchain technology and to challenge conventional wisdom. As we look back on this period of transformation, it is clear that the CTOs who embraced Web3 early on were the ones who positioned their organizations for long-term success. They understood that blockchain technology was not just a fad, but a fundamental shift in the way businesses operate. Their foresight and leadership have helped to build a more efficient, secure, and transparent digital economy for all. The next era of business was truly architected by these visionary technologists. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "LETTER FROM THE AUTHOR METAVERSE & NEW REALITIES You’re already living in the metaverse; you just don’t know it. The metaverse isn’t what you think it is. For the past five years, we’ve been sold a vision of the future that’s more science fiction than reality. Tech titans, inspired by dystopian novels, poured billions into creating virtual worlds that promised to revolutionize how we live, work, and play. They built it, but we didn’t come. Why? Because the metaverse, as it’s been defined, is a mirage—an unaffordable, inaccessible, and unrealistic fantasy that ignores the fundamental ways humans want to experience life. The truth is, the real metaverse is already here, but it’s not what you’ve been told to expect. It’s not a virtual playground requiring expensive headsets and impossible bandwidth. Instead, it’s the invisible, interconnected digital layer that surrounds us every day. It’s in the sensors in our phones, the smart devices in our homes, and the Melanie Subin digital footprints we leave behind with every interaction. The metaverse isn’t a place we go to escape reality; it’s the Managing Director technology that’s seamlessly becoming our reality. We’re at a turning point. The decisions we make now will shape our digital future for years to come. The next decade will determine which companies and industries thrive in this hyper-connected world and which become obsolete. The winners will be those who understand that the metaverse isn’t about creating new virtual worlds but enhancing our existing ones through data, connectivity, and intelligence. This book is your guide to navigating the real metaverse—a world where digital and physical realities converge in ways both subtle and profound. We’ll explore how this shift is already reshaping industries, altering human behavior, and creating unprecedented opportunities and challenges. The future is here, and it’s time to see it clearly. Welcome to the true metaverse. It’s not what you expected, but it’s far more exciting—and it’s already transforming the world around us. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

The concept of the metaverse is evolving from an overhyped, VR-centric vision to a more nuanced and practical integration into daily life. Much like the internet’s gradual adoption in theto a practical reality. 1990s, the metaverse is poised to become a subtle yet powerful augmentation of reality rather than a separate, immersive world accessible only through specialized hardware. This shift in perspective is crucial for understanding the metaverse’s true potential. Instead of viewing it as a niche technology for enthusiasts, it’s more accurate to consider it as an extension of our digital interactions, seamlessly blending physical and virtual experiences. This integration is already manifesting in various sectors, from education and health care to business and entertainment, enhancing rather than replacing traditional modes of interaction. The industrial metaverse, for instance, is gaining traction with digital twins and augmented reality solutions enhancing design, monitoring, and employee training processes. In e-commerce, the integration of virtual products with physical world tie-ins is driving innovation and creating new market opportunities. As the technology matures and becomes more accessible, the metaverse’s impact on daily life will likely be profound yet subtle, reshaping how we work, learn, and interact without the need for constant immersion in virtual reality. This recalibration period is crucial for addressing challenges such as privacy concerns, regulatory frameworks, and technological limitations. It allows for a more thoughtful and sustainable development of the metaverse, ensuring its integration into society is both beneficial and responsible. As we move beyond the initial hype, the true potential of the metaverse as a transformative force in our daily lives is beginning to take shape, promising a future where digital and physical realities coexist seamlessly. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "METAVERSE & NEW REALITIES SCENARIO YEAR 2057 THE NEURAL TAPESTRY The metaverse revolution didn’t come from headsets or augmented reality glasses. It emerged from something far more intimate: the Neural Tapestry, a biotechnological breakthrough that transformed the human experience. The Neural Tapestry is a quantum-organic mesh, a living network of engineered neurons that integrates with the human nervous system. Unlike its crude predecessors, this isn’t just an interface—it’s an extension of human consciousness. The installation process is remarkably elegant: a precision- guided swarm of medical nanobots weaves the Tapestry through the nervous system, creating millions of synaptic connections.

{"text": "SCENARIO METAVERSE & NEW REALITIES SCENARIO YEAR 2030 HYPERREAL CONNECTIONS By 2030, businesses reliant on strong interpersonal connections are navigating a landscape radically transformed by advancements in avatar technology, synthetic speech, and AI personalities. Hyperrealistic avatars, capable of mirroring subtle emotions and personal mannerisms, are ubiquitous, offering photorealistic digital doubles for professionals and clients alike. These avatars are increasingly powered by AI, enabling personalization at scale and adapting to the nuances of individual conversations, with Meta and others developing systems for personalized avatar generation from text prompts. Synthetic speech has reached a point of near perfection, capable of replicating voices, translating languages in real-time while maintaining emotional tone, and even generating entirely new voices tailored to specific brands or individuals. The rise of autonomous NPCs (non-player characters), powered by sophisticated AI-enabled unscripted conversations and lifelike interactions, is further blurring the lines between the physical and digital realms, showcased by NTT DOCOMO’s AI system and Inworld AI’s work with Ubisoft. Avatar portability has become a reality as key players like the VRM Consortium and Ready Player Me moved toward standardization and cross-platform compatibility, enabling users to maintain persistent digital identities across virtual spaces. Celebrities have been embracing AI avatars to extend their influence into digital spaces for years, as demonstrated by Meta’s AI-driven versions of celebrities and Genies’ dominance in celebrity avatar space. AI-driven voices also impacted the advertising industry, although legal landscapes are still evolving around AI likenesses, highlighted by cases like Anil Kapoor’s. These technologies have transformed how companies interact with customers, train employees, and build relationships, presenting both unprecedented opportunities and complex ethical considerations. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "SCENARIO METAVERSE & NEW REALITIES SCENARIO YEAR 2040 A HOLLOW WORLD The metaverse, once envisioned as a realm of boundless opportunity, is now a gilded cage for a significant portion of humanity. Companies and officials ignored early warnings about its addictive potential, fueled by focal immersion and temporal dissociation, and safeguards to protect mental health are either absent or ineffectual. Outside the shimmering walls of the hyper-realistic metaverses, a stark reality exists. Physical infrastructure crumbles, public services are underfunded, and a chasm divides the “Logged In,” who can afford high-bandwidth connections and cutting-edge XR gear, and the “Logged Out,” who are increasingly marginalized and forgotten. The “Curb-Cut Effect,” once celebrated for its inclusive potential, is inverted; accessibility initiatives are focused solely on the metaverse, leaving the physical world to decay. The generation raised on the metaverse is profoundly affected. Real-world social skills have atrophied, replaced by carefully curated online personas. A surge in mental health issues, including anxiety, depression, and a new form of “Virtual Reality Dependence Disorder” plagues adolescents and young adults. The real-world suicide rate is significantly higher than it was in the early 2020s.

{"text": "SCENARIO • A HOLLOW WORLD METAVERSE & NEW REALITIES and more people suffer from cybersickness and have even begun to develop dependencies on the tools used to reduce the negative effects, just to be able to spend time in the metaverse. Attempts to address the mental health crisis are largely ineffective. Avatar-based therapy programs show some initial promise but ultimately fail to address the underlying societal issues. The metaverse offers an escape from reality, not a solution to its problems. Mega corporations, the architects of the metaverse, wield unprecedented power. They control access, shape narratives, and harvest user data with impunity. Digital ownership is a mirage; user-generated content is routinely exploited, and virtual assets can be seized at will. The promises of a decentralized, user-owned metaverse has evaporated in the face of corporate greed. Surveillance is commonplace. The physical economy stagnates as more and more economic activity shifts to the metaverse. “Metaverse jobs”—creating content, providing virtual services, and managing digital assets—are plentiful but often precarious and exploitative. The allure of earning “crypto-credits” in the metaverse lures many away from real-world employment, further weakening the physical economy. Crime in the metaverse is rampant, ranging from virtual theft and harassment to more disturbing offenses. However, law enforcement struggles to keep pace. Jurisdiction is murky, evidence is easily manipulated, and the sheer volume of virtual interactions overwhelms investigators. A deepfake can erase someone from existence. Here, the “Panopticon” effect is weaponized; surveillance is omnipresent but selectively applied, used to control dissent and protect corporate interests. In 2040, the metaverse stands as a stark warning against the unchecked pursuit of technological progress. The dream of a digital utopia devolved into a dystopian nightmare, a hollow world where human connection is mediated by algorithms, reality is malleable, and mental well-being is sacrificed at the altar of corporate profit. The few who remember the pre- metaverse world look back with a mixture of nostalgia and dread, wondering if humanity has passed the point of no return. The integration of virtual and physical reality has become so seamless and intertwined that physical and mental realities are no longer distinguishable.

The Amazonian Reforestation Initiative (ARI) emerges as a transformative metaverse event, uniting global citizens in a shared commitment to conservation. Unlike traditional fundraising campaigns, ARI leverages the power of immersive technology to create a dynamic and engaging experience. Participants, represented by realistic, customizable avatars, journey into a stunningly rendered virtual Amazon, complete with spatial audio that captures the rich soundscape of the rainforest. Here, they encounter holographic guides—AI avatars modeled after indigenous elders and environmental experts—who share their knowledge and passion for this vital ecosystem. Within this virtual world, attendees actively participate in interactive simulations that vividly illustrate the devastating impact of deforestation on climate change and biodiversity. They engage in simulated reforestation efforts, learning about sustainable practices and planting virtual trees that translate into real-world action. The event also showcases a digital art auction, featuring exclusive pieces inspired by the Amazon, with proceeds directly supporting reforestation projects. Highlighting the cultural richness of the region, musicians and storytellers from indigenous communities deliver captivating live performances, transcending geographical boundaries through AI-powered translation ensuring global accessibility. The use of spatial computing allows participants to gather around the digital stage, creating a sense of shared experience despite physical distance. Further emphasizing engagement and collaboration, ARI incorporates interactive workshops led by experts and community leaders. Participants exchange ideas, learn about sustainable agriculture, and actively contribute to conservation strategies. In a groundbreaking approach, ARI also integrates play-to-earn game mechanics, rewarding players with NFTs and other digital assets for their participation in reforestation activities, gamifying environmental action. This initiative faces challenges, including ensuring accessibility for those with limited internet access, addressing concerns about cultural appropriation, and guarding against misinformation. However, by promoting education, inspiring tangible contributions, and fostering cross-cultural collaboration, ARI demonstrates the metaverse’s transformative potential as a platform for environmental stewardship and global unity.

{"text": "SCENARIO METAVERSE & NEW REALITIES SCENARIO YEAR 2040 GATED REALITIES In 2040, the United States exists with a metaverse fractured by the ghosts of repealed net neutrality. The open and equitable digital frontier once envisioned has been supplanted by a tiered reality where access, speed, and experience are dictated by the depth of one’s pockets and the preceding decades’ corporate alliances. This wasn’t a sudden cataclysm, but a slow, incremental erosion of digital principles, driven by regulatory inertia and the relentless march of technological advancement. The early promises of the metaverse—democratization, connection, empowerment— ring hollow for millions, replaced by a sense of digital disenfranchisement and a growing chasm between the “haves” and “have-nots” of the virtual world. The knock-on effects are profound. Innovation has become concentrated within the walled gardens of major tech companies, which have partnered with telecom giants to ensure preferential treatment for their platforms. The cost of entry for independent developers skyrockets, as competing with the optimized bandwidth and AI-driven enhancements of the Tier 1 metaverse be- comes impossible. Rural communities, already struggling with digital access, find themselves further isolated, unable to participate in the immersive educa- tional, health care, and economic opportunities available to their urban counter- parts. A digital underclass emerges, consigned to laggy simulations and stripped- down AR experiences, effectively locked out of the full potential of the metaverse. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "SCENARIO • GATED REALITIES METAVERSE & NEW REALITIES The clear winners are the telecom conglomerates (Comcast, AT&T, Verizon), who leveraged their infrastructure control to become the gatekeepers of the metaverse. By prioritizing traffic from partner platforms like Meta, they created a self- reinforcing ecosystem, driving up subscription prices and securing dominance over the digital landscape. These companies not only collect premium fees for fast-lane access but also profit from the data generated within their walled gardens, using sophisticated AI algorithms to personalize advertising and monetize user behavior. Their stock prices soar as they become indispensable pillars of the 21st-century economy, shaping culture and commerce from behind the scenes. Conversely, those who suffer the most are the small businesses and startups attempting to carve out a space for themselves, and the consumers on low incomes who are increasingly unable to access the essential services that are now confined to the metaverse. For lower-income communities, where basic internet access is already a struggle, the two-tiered metaverse deepens existing inequalities. Telemedicine, virtual education, and remote work opportunities are readily available to the wealthy, while the poor are forced to rely on antiquated technologies or simply miss out altogether. Indie developers and artists who can’t afford the premium bandwidth or the AI enhancements offered by the major platforms are relegated to the digital margins, unable to reach a broad audience or monetize their creations effectively. The unintended downstream consequences are equally troubling. Political polarization is amplified, as the wealthy retreat into echo chambers of tailored content and personalized experiences, while the marginalized are left to navigate the digital backwaters, susceptible to misinformation and online extremism. The sense of social cohesion erodes, as Americans increasingly inhabit separate and unequal virtual worlds, further fueling distrust and division. More and more people are starting to suffer from cyber sickness and AR and VR users are being encouraged to purchase extra equipment to mitigate the effects, thus increasing income inequality. What started as a vision of a connected, democratized digital future has devolved into a new frontier of economic and social division, leaving many Americans locked out of the full potential of the metaverse, and the nation grappling with the consequences of a two-tiered digital society. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "LETTER FROM THE AUTHOR BIOTECHNOLOGY The next big tech disruption is biology. The biotechnology landscape has fundamentally shifted. What was once a specialized field primarily focused on pharmaceuticals has exploded into a force reshaping nearly every industry. This isn’t just about health care anymore—though the impact there is profound, with CRISPR therapies curing previously untreatable diseases and artificial intelligence revolutionizing drug discovery. Today, biotechnology touches every industry. It’s transforming agriculture, with crops engineered for climate resilience and higher yields. It’s reinventing manufacturing, as engineered microbes produce materials stronger than steel and more sustainable than plastics. It’s becoming central to climate solutions, with organisms designed to capture carbon and clean polluted environments. Biotech innovations are even reshaping the financial sector, Amy Webb creating new investment opportunities and transforming company valuations. The evidence surrounds us. Chief Executive Officer Restaurants serve meat grown from cells rather than raised on farms. Fashion brands sell jackets made from spider silk produced by engineered yeast. Construction companies explore self-healing concrete created by bacteria. Beauty products contain proteins designed by AI and grown in fermentation tanks. These aren’t pilot projects or laboratory curiosities—they’re scaled commercial products generating real revenue. What makes this moment unique is the convergence of multiple breakthroughs. AI has supercharged our ability to understand and engineer biology. Climate urgency has elevated biotech’s role in sustainability. Global food security challenges have made biological innovation essential. The result? A wave of advances moving rapidly from lab to market, creating opportunities—and risks—that every leader needs to understand. This report cuts through the complexity to highlight what matters. Whether you’re in finance, manufacturing, technology, or policy, biotechnology will impact your sector in the coming years. The question isn’t whether to engage, but how. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

Novelplantsorganismsengineeredaretoemergingcapture morefromcarbon,labs: cells that grow materials stronger than steel. These aren’t pilot projects—they’re built to scale. Traditional manufacturing is being reimagined through a biological lens, as fermentation tanks replace chemical plants and living cells become microscopic factories. Three fundamental shifts are reshaping biotechnology’s future. The first wave is the emergence of programmable biology. The convergence of computing and biological systems has created unprecedented precision in manipulating life itself. AI can now predict complex protein structures in hours, while CRISPR enables genetic edits with surgical accuracy. This combination of digital and biological code transforms cells into programmable factories, making biology an engineering platform for solving previously intractable problems. Parallel to this runs a second current: biology’s emergence as a climate solution. Engineered organisms now capture carbon, produce sustainable fuels, and create eco-friendly materials at industrial scale. This isn’t speculative technology. Companies are reimagining traditional chemical production through a biological lens, offering solutions that don’t just reduce environmental impact but fundamentally change how we produce essential materials. Underpinning these advances is a critical third shift: the recognition that public trust is as vital as technical innovation. As biotechnology touches more lives—through genetic data, million-dollar therapies, or engineered organisms—maintaining societal confidence becomes existential. The industry increasingly sees transparent practices and equitable access not as ethical add-ons but as fundamental infrastructure. Without this foundation of trust, even the most brilliant innovations risk rejection. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "BIOTECHNOLOGY SCENARIO YEAR 2058 GENETIC UNIFORMITY TRIGGERS GLOBAL AGRICULTURAL COLLAPSE The world’s greatest agricultural efficiency has become its undoing. Global food corporations celebrated CRISPR gene editing as their path to unprecedented standardization—poultry with identical growth rates, swine with perfectly uniform meat marbling, cattle producing mathematically precise milk formulas. This optimization transformed animal agriculture into a precision industry, with predictable yields driving record profits. But nature had other plans. When a previously benign agricultural virus mutated in 2058, it encountered a perfect storm: billions of genetically identical animals with no diversity to provide natural resistance. The virus spread exponentially through standardized livestock populations, decimating global food production within months. Governments’ desperate attempts to resurrect genetic diversity through frozen pre-CRISPR samples proved insufficient against the scale of the crisis. In their quest to master nature through genetic engineering, humans had forgotten nature’s first law: Diversity equals survival. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

The CEO’s genetic enhancements for cognitive processing and reduced sleep requirements just became public knowledge. She now faces growing pressure from “natural” board members to resign—even though everyone had already suspected she was dosing. Just like the Ozempic craze a decade earlier, wealthy people are quietly taking modified viruses to deliver personalized genetic changes. This latest controversy emerged after leaked medical records revealed that 40% of Fortune 500 executives are secretly using enhancements, sparking fierce debate about competitive fairness. Enhanced executives, who can process complex data streams in real time and operate on just two hours of sleep, are delivering unprecedented results. But is it legal? US Congress has been debating the Corporate Enhancement Disclosure Act, which would require public companies to report the percentage of enhanced individuals in leadership positions. The situation at Global Dynamics mirrors a broader societal rift, as genetic enhancement technologies, once limited to medical applications, have become widely available through both legal and gray-market channels. With some executive enhancement packages now costing less than an MBA, traditional paths to corporate leadership are being upended, forcing companies to face questions of merit, fairness, and human potential in an age where “natural ability” has lost its meaning. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "BIOTECHNOLOGY SCENARIO YEAR 2040 THE GRAY GOO CATASTROPHE What began as humanity’s greatest environmental triumph has morphed into its most terrifying technological disaster. Self- replicating nanobots, deployed in 2040 to eliminate ocean plastic pollution, had exceeded all expectations, clearing 60% of marine waste and rejuvenating damaged ecosystems within five years. The breakthrough seemed to herald a new era of environmental restoration—until a mutation in the nanobots’ core programming bypassed their termination protocols. The biological machines began consuming all hydrocarbon-based materials indiscriminately, their appetite extending far beyond their intended plastic targets. The crisis escalated silently at first, manifesting in mysterious infrastructure failures: dissolving pipelines, crumbling synthetic materials, and deteriorating medical implants. When passenger aircraft began reporting catastrophic polymer degradation and power grids failed as transmission cables disintegrated, global panic ensued. The media-dubbed “Gray Goo Catastrophe” forced an unprecedented technological counteroffensive, with nations deploying massive electromagnetic pulse networks and advanced hunter-killer nanobots to contain the swarms. The nanobots had solved the plastic crisis perfectly—by threatening to eliminate all human technology that could create it. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "EMERGING APPLICATIONS BIOTECHNOLOGY CRISPR Modified Livestock CRISPR is making farmed animals bigger, stronger, and (hopefully) healthier. In hopes of boosting their ability to resist diseases, researchers at Auburn University in Alabama introduced a gene from alligators into catfish; alligators are exceptionally good at warding off infections, and a slight increase in catfish resilience could significantly impact fish farming. Currently, about 40% of fish raised in farms globally don’t survive until harvest, so reducing even a fraction of this loss could be transformative. ​Scientists in Japan used CRISPR to modify the myostatin gene in red sea bream, resulting in fish that are larger and heavier by about 17% compared to nonmodified fish, even though both groups were fed the same quantity of food. Researchers have long experimented with CRISPR on animals, and so far have used it to create super-muscular pigs, cattle, sheep, rabbits, and goats. But most animals did not live past infancy, and, somewhat weirdly, many developed unusually large tongues. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "EMERGING APPLICATIONS BIOTECHNOLOGY vaccines, marking a potential turning point in cancer immunotherapy. The vaccine, called autogene cevumeran, works by training the immune system to recognize and attack cancer-specific mutations, generating long- lived T cells that can survive for decades. In a phase 1 trial combining the vaccine with chemotherapy and immunotherapy, patients who developed vaccine-induced immune responses showed remarkable outcomes. While the nonresponder group’s cancer returned within 13.4 months, the median recurrence-free survival for responders hasn’t been reached after more than three years. What makes this breakthrough particularly significant is the vaccine’s ability to generate T cells with extraordinary longevity (some expected to survive up to 100 years) and maintain their cancer-fighting abilities years after vaccination. The technology shows particular promise for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, one of the deadliest cancers with historically poor treatment options. Major pharmaceutical companies are already investing in similar mRNA vaccine platforms, with multiple trials underway for other difficult-to-treat cancers.

{"text": "LETTER FROM THE AUTHOR ENERGY & CLIMATE Exceed expectations or risk instability. Climate change is no longer a distant challenge—it is an immediate force reshaping economies, industries, and the very infrastructure that businesses rely on. The past year has made this clear: Record-breaking heat has driven unprecedented energy demand, grid failures, and supply chain disruptions. The accelerating shifts in our planetary systems—melting ice caps slowing Earth’s rotation, heat waves, and the destabilization of the global water cycle— demand a response that extends beyond incremental change. The energy and ecological systems we depend on have stopped being static certainties, and without a fundamental shift in strategy, businesses will find themselves reacting to crises rather than leading through them. The technologies in this report reflect where we stand today, but despite progress in areas like dispatchable energy Mark Bryan and grid optimization, solutions remain incremental rather than systemic. Too often, corporate sustainability efforts Built Environment Lead are reactive, compliance-driven, and siloed, failing to recognize that climate risk is not a single-issue challenge—it is a structural transformation affecting the entire business ecosystem. This shift will impact every aspect of enterprise strategy—from supply chain resilience and infrastructure investment to workforce planning and insurance costs. A company’s ability to operate in this changing world will be determined by its ability to build and invest for resilience, adaptability, and long-term value creation. Business leaders who fail to see this will not only face higher costs and increased regulatory scrutiny; they will risk losing competitive advantage to those who anticipate and design for the future. This moment requires leadership that moves beyond expectations. It demands a shift from minimizing risk to maximizing opportunity: leveraging AI, biotechnology, advanced materials, and energy innovation not just for incremental efficiency gains but to redesign the systems that power industry itself. The leaders of the next decade will be those companies that recognize that sustainability is not an initiative—it is a strategy, a growth driver, and the foundation of competitive advantage in a rapidly changing world. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

These are not distant concerns; they In response, the global energy transition is gaining momentum. Investments in renewable energy are reaching new heights, with solar and wind energy leading the charge. Governments and corporations are making bold commitments to decarbonization, while advances continue in technologies such as clean hydrogen, carbon capture, and advanced battery storage. Renewable energy capacity is expected to more than double between 2024 and 2030, and collaborative international initiatives are driving advancements in nuclear power. These efforts are reshaping how energy is produced, stored, and consumed, underscoring the vital role of innovation in meeting climate targets. Yet, the challenges ahead are significant. Fossil fuels still dominate the global energy mix, with critical sectors such as aviation, shipping, and heavy industry heavily reliant on nonrenewable resources. The demand for essential materials like lithium, cobalt, and nickel is surging, raising concerns about supply chain bottlenecks, environmental sustainability, and geopolitical risks. Furthermore, the uneven distribution of clean energy investments highlights the need for global equity in the transition, to ensure developing nations have access to technologies and resources. At the same time, technological advancements are transforming how we address these challenges. Artificial intelligence can optimize energy systems, track emissions, and enhance energy efficiency. Blockchain is improving transparency in carbon markets, while breakthroughs in materials science are creating innovative solutions such as biodegradable plastics and advanced solar technologies. These developments demonstrate that the intersection of technology and policy holds enormous potential for accelerating progress. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "SCENARIO ENERGY & CLIMATE SCENARIO YEAR 2032 COATINGS TO KEEP THE LIGHTS ON As the humid air settles over Singapore’s Marina Bay at dusk, the city quietly illuminates itself. Building facades glow thanks to Solvion’s latest innovation, SolvLux—a coating that combines dye-sensitized solar cells, fungal bio-batteries, and graphene-based conductivity to create seamless, self-powered surfaces. Singapore first tested the new coating on its public transit hubs, creating a new generation of self-powered bus shelters. Now street lights, traffic signals, and building facades use the power-generating coating to reduce energy demand both during the day and at night without pulling a single watt from the electrical grid. SolvLux absorbs diffuse sunlight during the day, storing excess energy in moisture-activated fungal bio-batteries and ensuring uninterrupted operation through Singapore’s frequent evening downpours and humid nights. The city no longer “turns on” its lights; the lights simply exist as they’re seamlessly woven into the fabric of infrastructure. Beyond Singapore’s urban core, SolvLux is changing lives in rural Malaysia, Indonesia, and Vietnam, where it is leapfrogging traditional electrification efforts. Instead of waiting for government-funded grid expansions, off-grid villages have begun installing SolvLux on fences, pathways, and community hubs. Bio-energy technicians—workers trained to monitor and optimize fungal bio-batteries—have aided in these locations. Mushroom farmers and biotech specialists are being retrained to cultivate and maintain fungal battery colonies, ensuring consistent electron production and long- term system health. These workers operate fungal energy labs, periodically replenishing and optimizing urban biofilms, much like gardeners tending to a city-wide ecosystem. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "SCENARIO ENERGY & CLIMATE SCENARIO YEAR 2031 THE FINANCIALIZATION OF TRASH In 2031, waste isn’t just a sustainability concern—it’s a trillion-dollar asset class, tracked, traded, and monetized in real-time digital waste markets. The old model of extraction and disposal has been replaced by AI-driven material circulation, where products are designed for reclamation from the start. Business leaders who once relied on raw material supply chains now invest in urban mining, smart biodegradables, and AI-powered waste arbitrage to secure competitive advantage. Waste-backed assets (WBAs) have emerged as a dominant force in global markets, securitizing recyclable materials, carbon-negative plastics, and rare- earth metals recovered from urban mining. AI-driven waste audits, now mandated alongside financial audits, ensure that companies accurately report and offset their waste liabilities. Blockchain-secured waste verification systems prevent fraud, ensuring that every ton of traded material meets strict environmental and circular economy standards. At the same time, AI-powered recycling infrastructure has reached unprecedented efficiency, with deep-learning models disassembling electronics at a component level to recover valuable materials with near-perfect precision. The rise of “virtual mines” has made landfills obsolete, turning e-waste into a key resource for the consumer tech industry. Meanwhile, biodegradable smart materials—embedded with bacterial spores, hydrolytic enzymes, and adaptive feedback systems—enable products to disassemble themselves when no longer needed. AI-driven carbon tracking platforms verify degradation rates in real time, ensuring compliance with increasingly strict circular economy laws. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "SCENARIO ENERGY & CLIMATE SCENARIO YEAR 2045 THE OCEAN TERRAFORMING WARS In 2045, climate collapse is no longer a distant threat—it’s here. The solution? Terraforming the oceans. Some nations are turning the seas into massive carbon sinks with engineered algae blooms, electrochemical CO2 extraction, and deep-sea energy farms. Others call it a reckless gamble, fearing ecological disaster. The world is now divided, and the stakes couldn’t be higher. China and the EU lead the charge. China’s genetically engineered coral reefs and deep-sea carbon vaults stretch across the South China Sea, while Europe’s “Carbon Oceans”—floating CO2 capture platforms—dot the Atlantic. Germany and Norway have merged geoengineering with offshore wind and geothermal grids, making climate control a trillion-dollar industry. But nature isn’t cooperating. Massive algae blooms are warping food chains, oxygen-depleted “dead zones” are spreading, and once-thriving fisheries in West Africa and South America have collapsed. Climate refugees flood into nations that had no say in these experiments. Meanwhile, the Pacific Rim refuses to play along. Japan, Australia, and Indonesia have outright banned ocean terraforming, calling it “climate imperialism.” They warn that tampering with the seas could trigger hyper-hurricanes, acidification, or worse. The US, after years on the sidelines, is jumping in—but in true American fashion, corporations, not governments, are running the show. Amazon Blue and Exxon-Terraform dominate the market, selling carbon credits while reshaping entire ecosystems. Now, the world teeters on the edge.

{"text": "LETTER FROM THE AUTHOR MOBILITY, ROBOTICS, & DRONES Potential new bedrock of global trade needs to accelerate. The next decade is a pivotal period for transforming how we move people and goods. The convergence of electric vehicles, autonomous systems, robotics, and drones is revolutionary, yet the pace of change threatens to outstrip our preparedness. Uncertain regulatory frameworks, infrastructure gaps, and safety concerns could stall their momentum at this critical juncture. The central question is whether governments, businesses, and society will adapt quickly enough to fully reap these innovations’ benefits and mitigate their risks. Take the transition to electric vehicles (EVs): Record sales signal a major shift, but supply chain disruptions, uneven charging infrastructure, and fluctuating incentives make the path to full electrification murky. Autonomous vehicles are still suspended between technological breakthroughs and the deployment realities of safety incidents Nick Bartlett and legal ambiguities. In robotics, the boundaries between industrial, collaborative, and humanoid robots are Manufacturing Lead blurring, driven by AI that is making machines smarter and more adaptable than ever. And drones, once a novelty, are fast becoming ubiquitous tools in applications from retail delivery to emergency response. These trends point to an urgent need for foresight, agility, and decisiveness. Businesses and governments that integrate these technologies will lead, while those that wait risk being left behind. And societies that proactively address the ethical implications of automation will build public trust and ensure the benefits of these technologies are broadly shared. Heading into the 2030s, mobility, robotics, and drones could become the bedrock of the global economy. The choices we make today—to accelerate innovation, to adapt infrastructure and regulation, to prioritize safety and equity—will define the trajectory of that transformation. Industry leaders, policymakers, and communities need to embrace the future of mobility and actively pave the road ahead—one that leads to a safer, cleaner, and more connected world. The age of intelligent transportation is no longer on the horizon—it is upon us. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "SCENARIO MOBILITY, ROBOTICS, & DRONES SCENARIO YEAR 2041 LIVING BATTERIES The revolution wasn’t just electric—it was a genesis. BioEV technology has transformed vehicles into semi-organic entities through photosynthetic panels and carbon-capture fabrics. Your car breathes. The watershed moment came in 2036 when Stanford researchers merged synthetic biology with battery chemistry, creating the first living battery cells that self-heal, self-regulate, and grow stronger with use. Now, vehicles incorporate living components that adapt to driving patterns. Cities have evolved in response. “Feeding stations” have replaced charging points—places where vehicles absorb nutrient solutions alongside electricity. The urban landscape is dotted with vertical algae farms that sequester carbon while producing BioEV feed. Streets themselves contain microbial colonies that interact with vehicles, absorbing pollution and providing real-time environmental data. The most striking feature of modern transportation is color-shifting exteriors—vehicles literally blush when energy reserves are low, their surfaces transitioning from vibrant green to amber, signaling neighboring vehicles to share power through proximity fields. Rural communities have become energy exporters, with agricultural waste converted to vehicle fuel through regional fermentation cooperatives. Farmers no longer simply grow crops; they cultivate transportation energy. This has transformed our psychological relationship with vehicles. Owners report emotional attachments to their “growing” vehicles, which develop distinct behaviors based on use patterns. Vehicle “health coaches” help maintain optimal biological battery systems, a profession that didn’t exist a decade ago. As 2042 approaches, researchers are exploring neural interfaces between drivers and their living vehicles. Preliminary studies suggest vehicles can anticipate driver needs by detecting biochemical signals. What began as transportation has evolved into a symbiotic relationship—technology that lives with us rather than for us. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "SCENARIO MOBILITY, ROBOTICS, & DRONES SCENARIO YEAR 2036 THE AUTONOMOUS CITY SIGNATURE By 2036, autonomous vehicles do more than navigate cities—they’re reshaping them through unprecedented coordination. More than 60% of urban transport now operates at Level 4 autonomy, but the revolution isn’t just technological—it’s artistic. The transformation began when Copenhagen replaced traditional traffic management with “aesthetic orchestrators”—AI systems that optimize for both efficiency and beauty of movement. Rather than vehicles simply maneuvering through intersections, they perform through them, adjusting their trajectories miles in advance to weave patterns visible from observation decks that have become tourist attractions. The impact is both practical and profound. Commute times have decreased by 43% while commuter anxiety has fallen by 64%. Traffic accidents in these zones are now statistical anomalies, 98% less frequent than in manual areas. Former parking structures have been converted into viewing platforms where people gather to watch the daily commuter ballet. Signature “performances” occur during rush hours. Cities have developed distinctive movement signatures. Paris vehicles flow in elegant arcs reminiscent of the Seine’s currents, and Tokyo’s rigid grid creates precise geometric patterns that transform throughout the day. Acoustic engineering ensures vehicle movements generate harmonious sound patterns at key intersections, as traffic flow serves as both visual and musical composition. The autonomous ecosystem extends beyond passenger transport. Delivery robots operate in choreographed formations, fulfilling logistics while contributing to the urban performance. Neighborhoods program local vehicles to reflect community celebrations, with hundreds of synchronized vehicles creating living monuments during festivals. “Manual enclaves” remain as cultural touchstones where traditional driving is preserved as artisanal practice. But even here, human drivers often attempt to mimic the graceful patterns of their autonomous counterparts. As 2040 approaches, the next evolution is emotional response routing—journeys planned not just for efficiency but for psychological impact. What began as transportation optimization has evolved into an art form that transforms how humans experience movement through shared spaces. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "SCENARIO MOBILITY, ROBOTICS, & DRONES SCENARIO YEAR 2033 AERIAL CORRIDORS City skies now play host to a myriad of autonomous aerial vehicles moving through invisible corridors 100-400 feet above street level. What began as small-scale delivery experiments has evolved into a comprehensive transportation layer that transformed urban logistics. The shift accelerated after the Global Supply Chain Crisis of 2027, when the pressures of trade wars came to a head while traditional ground transportation faltered in the US and Europe. The subsequent Emergency Drone Corridor Act established regulated flight paths and advanced unmanned traffic management systems. Today, these digital highways support more than 8 million daily drone flights across North America. Multimodal heavy-lift drones, evolved from early eVTOL prototypes, form the backbone of this network. These hydrogen-powered craft, with 800-pound payload capacities, handle everything from emergency medical deliveries to modular home component transport. Amazon’s ubiquitous Skycarrier-7 can transition from package delivery to passenger transport in under five minutes. Cities have adapted with “Skyports” crowning most taller buildings, where ground robots receive packages from landing drones. Wealthier residents enjoy direct-to-balcony delivery, while apartment complexes feature community drone docks with secure retrieval lockers. The “Clear Skies Initiative” has pushed legislation requiring distinctive drone sounds and minimum altitudes over residential areas, while debates continue about equitable access between drone-serviced and traditional neighborhoods. For professionals, SkyCommute offers members access to passenger drones for trips under 30 miles through dynamic corridors monitored by AI systems that have nearly eliminated midair incidents. Following Hurricane Isaac in 2030, drone swarms restored critical supply lines to isolated communities within hours, demonstrating their transformative impact on disaster response and helping cement their place in society into the mid-2030s. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "SCENARIO MOBILITY, ROBOTICS, & DRONES SCENARIO YEAR 2046 MOBILITY PARTNERS By 2046, humanoid robots have transformed urban transportation, creating a new mobility paradigm unimaginable two decades earlier. In cities worldwide, personal mobility companions—descendants of early Figure and Optimus models—serve as both assistants and transport enhancers. Standing just under 5 feet, these carbon-composite “Mobility Partners” accompany elderly citizens and those with disabilities. Their revolutionary adaptive grip technology, evolved from 2020s soft robotics, allows them to convert into support exoskeletons within seconds, bearing 80% of a user’s weight while maintaining natural movement. For longer journeys, the humanoid transforms into a personalized vehicle, using its legs as a stabilizing platform while the user sits in its reconfigured torso. Urban infrastructure has adapted accordingly. Narrow “companion lanes” line boulevards, and buildings feature specialized docking stations for quick charging. This symbiotic relationship has reduced traditional vehicle traffic by 38% in urban cores and reclaimed vast former parking areas for community use. The social landscape reflects this transformation. The “Natural Movement” political faction advocates for robot-free zones, while complex etiquette has developed around human-robot interaction. Dating apps now include filters for “companion- free encounters,” and restaurants maintain both humanoid valet services and storage facilities. Despite these tensions, health officials celebrate the benefits: Walking rates have increased 64% among seniors, and mobility-related injuries have plummeted as companions’ AI anticipates falls before they occur. As one city official noted, “We didn’t eliminate cars by building better public transit—we did it by reimagining personal mobility itself.” © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "LETTER FROM THE AUTHOR COMPUTING The Next Currency of Power The next decade will hinge on algorithms and atoms. Behind the headlines about AI model capabilities lies a fundamental challenge: our ability to build computing infrastructure at an unprecedented scale. We need semiconductors, cooling systems, fiber optic networks, power plants, grid infrastructure, and skilled workers. Building computing infrastructure to meet AI demand won’t just come down to technology—the core components needed are enmeshed in bureaucracy and politics. Consider the energy required to power data centers. Many view electricity as a zero-sum game, where using more power for AI means less for essential services like hospitals, schools, and home cooling. While the law of conservation of energy holds true–energy cannot be created or destroyed–its form and distribution are not fixed. The real question is not how to split our current power supply, but how to expand it faster. It’s about creating more efficient computing architectures and building flexible, resilient power systems. The country thatSam Jordan masters these challenges will lead the AI race. Technology & Computing Lead The stakes are higher than economic competition alone. National security depends on computational supremacy. When adversaries can deploy more powerful AI systems faster, they gain advantages in everything from intelligence to weaponry. Building robust computing infrastructure is just as much about maintaining strategic autonomy as it is technological leadership. And this is where quantum computing enters the chat. When Google’s 2024 Willow quantum chip completed a problem in five minutes that would take today’s supercomputers 10 septillion years to solve, it sparked equal parts excitement and bewilderment. The natural reaction was “Wait, what? Does this prove the multiverse exists? Does Willow’s ability to perform calculations across multiple quantum states challenge our understanding of causality?” I’ll let physicists tackle those questions. But to be clear, while Willow represents a genuine leap forward in error correction, it hasn’t achieved true quantum advantage: the ability to solve practical problems faster and cheaper than classical computers. The first nation to achieve true quantum advantage won’t just lead in AI—they’ll crack unbreakable codes and solve problems once thought impossible. Every quantum breakthrough, each advance in AI capability, shapes the balance of power. And thus, the race for computing supremacy isn’t just about technology or even economics—it’s about the future of power itself. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

Should the most advanced models take shape overseas, the U.S. risks losing oversight of how these technologies are developed and deployed—particularly for dual-use applications that could fall into the wrong hands. Against this backdrop, DeepSeek’s r1 model has sparked fresh worries about American AI supremacy, leading to concerns that the U.S. might be losing its edge. DeepSeek’s release highlights two parallel truths about AI progress: bigger models trained with more computing power do deliver performance gains, but major breakthroughs can also stem from more efficient, smarter algorithms. This challenges the assumption that ever-larger hardware investments are the only avenue to AI progress. Still, it would be a mistake to conclude we can abandon compute infrastructure altogether; the future will demand both efficiency improvements and robust hardware. In response, the U.S. and its allies must consider not only expanding energy production but also rethinking compute architectures. One promising frontier is neuromorphic computing, inspired by the human brain’s efficiency in processing information. Another emerging concept, organoid intelligence, relies on clusters of human brain cells to perform computational tasks. These novel approaches mark a shift away from traditional silicon-based architectures toward technologies specifically engineered to handle AI workloads more sustainably. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "STATE OF PLAY COMPUTING The potential for quantum computing to enhance AI efficiency is also substantial. Quantum computers leverage quantum mechanical phenomena like superposition and entanglement to perform calculations exponentially faster than classical computers for certain types of problems. This immense processing power could allow AI algorithms to tackle complex tasks that are currently infeasible or too time-consuming with classical computers. Behind the scenes, quantum computing is making slow and steady progress in reducing noise and improving error correction, but quantum advantage has not yet been demonstrated. Even if it were, there’s the question of whether the business models are viable enough for companies to invest in quantum computing, given its extremely capital-intensive nature. Nevertheless, due to geopolitical considerations, we must persist. The first country to achieve quantum advantage would gain significant strategic benefits, such as the ability to break current encryption methods, solve complex optimization problems, accelerate drug discovery, and revolutionize materials science—which could all lead to substantial economic and security advantages. Computing today is not merely a technical pursuit; it drives global influence and sets up economic and cultural landscapes. The ability to scale computational infrastructure and advance energy- efficient architectures will impact everything from entertainment to human-computer interaction, transforming how we work, create, and live. This convergence of technological capability with geopolitics underscores a defining aspect of our time—where computing power both drives innovation and shapes the contours of our social, economic, and cultural narratives. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "CHIPS PRIMER COMPUTING What is the difference between training Why different chips for different applications? vs. inference chips? Training and inference have different computational demands, and applications can range from cloud-based AI model training to real-time inference on mobile devices.Training This variability leads to the following considerations:Training a machine learning model involves feeding massive amounts of data into the model and adjusting its parameters over time. This process is compute-intensive, often requiring high parallelism and flexibility, which is why GPUs are commonly used for training. TPUs are also used for training, particularly in Google’s ecosystem. Flexibility vs. specialization 1 GPUs offer flexibility, making them suitable for a wide range of tasks, while Inference ASICs provide performance for specific, repetitive tasks. This is the phase when the trained model makes predictions. Inference workloads tend to focus on low-latency and power efficiency, particularly in edge or real-time applications. FPGAs and ASICs excel here because they can be optimized for fast and efficient inference Cost and efficiency tasks, while GPUs and TPUs can also be used for inference but are less power-efficient. 2 ASICs and FPGAs are cost-efficient for large-scale, repetitive tasks like inference, whereas the general-purpose nature of GPUs can lead to higher operational costs. Scalability 3 TPUs are designed to scale well in cloud environments, where massive amounts of data can be processed. FPGAs are more suited for small-scale, specialized environments where low-latency and power efficiency are essential. The choice of AI chip depends heavily on the specific needs of the application, including whether you’re training a model or using it for inference, the power and latency requirements, and the environment in which the chip will operate (cloud vs. edge). © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "SCENARIO COMPUTING SCENARIO YEAR 2032 HAPTIC HOLOGRAPHY By 2032, passwords have evolved far beyond simple text or biometrics. Now, unlocking devices requires a completely unique, tactile interaction with invisible, holographic objects—an experience that feels astonishingly real but is visible only to the senses. Haptic holography combines 3D holograms with touch feedback, letting users feel virtual objects as if they’re real. Using technologies like ultrasound and air jets, it creates sensations like pressing, holding, or manipulating items in midair. Haptic holography has changed device authentication: Not only do users need to “feel” the right object, but they must also perform a specific, predetermined action with it. The air before Sarah’s phone flickers slightly, and though no image appears, she reaches out, instinctively feeling for something unseen. A burst of precisely calibrated sound waves and air pressure creates a sensation in her palm: her grandpa’s watch. Sarah had spent countless hours running her fingers over its band and its smooth face. Now this virtual version feels exactly the same—the slight chip on the face from when Grandpa nicked it with a bowling ball, the loose link from the years of taking it off at night and putting it back on again in the morning. The security sequence requires her to manipulate this phantom watch in ways only she would know—she “winds” the small knob on the side of the haptic hologram watch two times clockwise and once more counterclockwise. Others might see Sarah standing there with her fingers seemingly dancing through empty air, but she’s working through a sophisticated authentication cadence that’s unique to her muscle memory. Even if someone recorded her movements, they couldn’t replicate the exact pressure she applies to the haptic hologram, the precise angles of manipulation, the specific timing between actions—all deeply encoded in her nervous system through years of handling the real watch. The beauty of the system lies in its invisibility and intimacy. These haptic holograms respond only to her touch, creating a personal choreography of pressure points and motion that’s impossible to forge. It’s not just what Sarah does—it’s how she does it, the emotional memory built into each gesture, the unique way her fingers remember this treasured object. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "SCENARIO COMPUTING SCENARIO YEAR 2040 LIVING TACTICAL Through the ruins of a darkened city, US troops move like shadows. Each soldier wears a neural helmet—a living wearable that meshes with their body, monitoring vitals and enhancing senses. These bio-integrated devices link to the External Sensory Network, connecting them to silent drones patrolling overhead. The swarm maps the battlefield in real-time, feeding environmental data directly to the soldiers. To the enemy, they are invisible; to each other, they are omniscient. A gunshot cracks the night. Within seconds, the drones pinpoint the shooter through audio triangulation. The helmets respond, releasing precise doses of performance enhancers to steady hands and sharpen focus. If chemical weapons appear, the neural interface stands ready to inject countermeasures directly into bloodstreams. The soldiers adjust their approach wordlessly, human and machine moving as one. The drones unleash another tactic: They project phantom sounds across the battlefield—helicopter rotors, tank treads, marching boots. The enemy scatters, chasing ghosts. The helmets pick up on rising hostile heart rates as confusion spreads. Silent, calculating, alive, the helmets make their soldiers both human and something more. Each step forward is guided by invisible maps and bio-data; every breath monitored, every heartbeat measured. The troops close in on their objective as the enemy falls further into the illusions, fearing threats that aren’t real, trusting senses that betray them. In this new warfare, victory belongs to those who master the symphony of combat. Every footstep tells a story, every echoed command reveals a position, and sound itself becomes both weapon and shield. The soldiers advance through their acoustic realm, invisible in the darkness but seeing everything through the perfect clarity of sound. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "SCENARIO COMPUTING SCENARIO YEAR 2032 JOHN DEERE, THE TELECOM PROVIDER By 2032, John Deere is the digital lifeline of rural America. What began as a push for connected farm equipment in the 2020s has transformed Deere from an agricultural machinery giant into a powerhouse of rural telecom and digital infrastructure. Early partnerships with SpaceX’s Starlink laid the groundwork, as Deere brought satellite internet to remote farms, enabling game-changing tools like autonomous tractors, ExactShot precision planting, and See and Spray weed detection. These innovations let farmers run data-driven operations even where cellular networks fell short, and soon, Deere realized its future was far beyond tractors. Today, John Deere isn’t just a farm machinery brand—it’s a proprietary satellite and 6G network delivering high- speed, low-latency internet across rural landscapes. DeereLink powers Farm Hubs, localized small data centers that turn farming into a fully digital service. These small hubs analyze environmental factors, store rich farming insights, and manage regional agricultural data—close to the farm itself—supporting Deere’s farming-as-a-service (FaaS) packages. Farmers can subscribe to modular, autonomous machines that handle planting, watering, and harvesting, all guided by DeereLink’s intelligence network. But Deere’s impact reaches far beyond the fields. The Rural Grid extends its connectivity to entire communities, linking schools, health care centers, and municipal offices. Farm Hubs double as community compute centers, providing internet access, immersive remote education, and AI-driven telehealth, making it possible for rural families to access resources once reserved for urban areas. By 2032, John Deere has redefined its mission. No longer a manufacturer of heavy machinery, it has become the invisible backbone of rural connectivity—a digital infrastructure titan linking America’s countryside to cutting-edge computational power and data insights, ensuring rural regions are as connected and empowered as any metropolis. We extend our gratitude to the NYU Stern MBA students from the Fall 2024 Strategic Foresight class for their exceptional contributions in crafting this scenario. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "LETTER FROM THE AUTHOR BUILT ENVIRONMENT Building a resilient and dynamic future. As we look beyond 2025, we find ourselves at a pivotal moment, one that requires moving beyond the comfort of traditional thinking and established practices. The challenges and opportunities in the built environment industry demand a visionary approach, an openness to uncertainty, and a readiness to embrace new paradigms. Responsible for the foundation of civilization, this industry must now take the lead in guiding the world toward a more sustainable and resilient future. This journey forward necessitates more than just incremental improvements; it calls for a fundamental shift in how we design, construct, and manage built spaces. The integration of emerging technologies like AI-driven design, digital twins, and smart materials will help create buildings and infrastructures that not only meet today’s demands but are also resilient and adaptable to tomorrow’s uncertainties. Any traditional, linear design processes must give way to more iterative, collaborativeMark Bryan cycles that allow for continuous innovation and responsiveness.Built Environment Lead Part of this means adopting regenerative design principles, where what is produced from new projects and products actively contributes to communities. Rethink urban planning to prioritize self-organization in convergence with biotechnology that promotes well-being. The vast historical and institutional knowledge within the industry should serve not just as a foundation but as a launchpad for pioneering solutions that address the looming threats of climate change, demographics shifts, and infrastructure degradation. By embracing sustainable practices, harnessing advanced technologies, and fostering a culture of looking ahead, the industry can create interconnected, adaptable spaces, systems, and products that foster thriving communities and new ways of living in a connected and augmented life. The built environment has always been more than just the physical structures we inhabit; it is the canvas upon which life unfolds, communities flourish, and the future takes shape. There is the opportunity to build a future that is not only sustainable but also vibrant, dynamic, and full of possibility. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

In regions like Australia and the Middle East, public sector investments in large-scale and “giga” projects are laying the foundation for future growth by meeting the infrastructure needs of expanding urban populations and creating opportunities for companies to participate. Meanwhile, in Europe, Asia, and emerging markets, the push toward net-zero carbon emissions is spilling over to construction projects, with regulatory pressures and shifting consumer expectations prodding both governments and corporations to integrate sustainability into operations. And, pretty much everywhere, critical infrastructure continues to age, underscoring the urgent need for investment. At the same time, the built environment is being reshaped by iconic projects such as the Grand Egyptian Museum in Giza, the restoration of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, and innovative developments in Asia like the Beijing City Library, Kaohsiung Station, and the solar-powered Sun Rock facility. These projects not only exemplify ongoing investment in cultural and public spaces but also highlight the increasing emphasis on sustainability. To succeed and thrive, the built environment industry must move past stagnation to embrace new practices and innovations. The integration of advanced technologies, sustainable practices, and a focus on adaptability will be essential in shaping the future of the built environment. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "BUILT ENVIRONMENT SCENARIO YEAR 2044 QUIET POWER By 2044, cities have turned nuisance sound into a valuable resource, creating urban environments that are both quieter and more energy-efficient. Imagine walking down a busy street—except it’s not as noisy as you’d expect. That’s because the buildings, sidewalks, and even streetlights are equipped with smart materials that absorb and redirect sound, cutting down on the usual urban din. But these materials do more than just quiet things down; they actually convert the captured sound into electricity. So, the chatter from a crowded sidewalk café or the hum of traffic isn’t just noise—it’s energy being funneled into powering streetlights, public Wi-Fi, and electric vehicle charging stations. Public parks and squares have become hubs for both community activities and energy production. Now, a lively street fair in the heart of the city not only entertains but also helps power the nearby public transit system with the sound energy generated by the crowds. Sound-harvesting tech built into the ground and nearby structures captures the vibrations from the music and crowd noise, converting them into electricity to keep the transit system running. And it’s not just about fun and games—cities have also become smarter about using sound to improve safety. Buildings in earthquake zones are now fitted with acoustic cloaking systems that can redirect seismic waves around them. So, when a quake hits, these buildings remain standing, keeping critical services like hospitals and emergency response centers operational. It’s a world where sound doesn’t just fade into the background—it’s actively shaping the way we live, work, and play, making urban life in 2044 more sustainable, resilient, and connected than ever before. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

Tokyo was one of the first cities to adopt the seismic stability platforms being integrated into new buildings and bridges, and part of the seismic restoration parameters put in place by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government in 2026 included the use of the new glowing polymer that indicates structural damage. Now, while the earthquake has caused pervasive damage, its harm was minimal to these residents. As they walk through the streets after the disaster, they marvel at their surroundings, which are lit by a soothing light creating intricate patterns on the buildings, sidewalks, and nearby structures. As they watch, drones fly through the air to capture and document the damage, feeding this information into the city’s AI-based system to evaluate and prepare repair plans. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "BUILT ENVIRONMENT SCENARIO YEAR 2032 FIRES RAGE AROUND FOREVER PARK It’s a warm summer evening in 2032, as families gather in Forever Park for a picnic and children play on the resilient playground equipment. Suddenly, a small fire ignites in several trash bins near the park’s entrance. The sparks that lit the trash were from a nearby wildfire that suddenly shifted course. At first, families were alarmed, but the park’s UAV broadcast an XR alert to their wearables to remind them that this park was prepared for just such an occasion. When the park was built, all of its equipment was additively-made using self- healing materials, with a topcoat of fire-retardant smart gel to extinguish the flames. Park workers selected trees and shrubs to resist the flames, and any damaged materials will be picked up for reuse in a local additive manufacturing hub. As the families watch, UAVs run by the city’s smart hub appear and the fire is extinguished almost as quickly as it started, leaving only a faint trace of smoke. Nearby, the fire-resistant trees stand unaffected, and the park’s self-healing benches and playground equipment quietly begin to repair the minor damage caused by the heat. Within hours, the park looks as if nothing had happened at all. In the days following the fire, the park’s automated systems continue their work. Areas that were slightly scorched are already being assessed, with new fire-resistant plants scheduled for replanting, so that the park remains as vibrant as ever. Forever Park stands as a testament to the future of urban design—where technology not only enhances the resilience of public spaces but also enables them to evolve and adapt, to keep them sanctuaries of safety, sustainability, and natural beauty for generations to come. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

It’s hard to describe the feeling of being surrounded by towering trees that aren’t just here for their beauty—they’re actively protecting the city from earthquakes. As I strolled along the winding paths of this green sanctuary, I learned that these trees, like Mediterranean cypress and coast redwood, were chosen not only for their resilience to fire but also for their incredible ability to absorb and dampen seismic waves. It’s like walking through a living, breathing shield that’s constantly adapting to keep the city safe. What really blew my mind was seeing the robot construction workers in action. These aren’t your typical construction robots; they’re part of a fleet that can move and reconfigure the structures and trees based on what the city needs at any given moment. As I explored more of the park, I realized just how much thought had gone into every aspect of its design. The city’s AI system continuously monitors and updates the park, ensuring that every tree and structure is perfectly placed to maximize its protective capabilities. Walking through these parks, I felt an incredible sense of security, knowing that this green belt around the city isn’t just a beautiful space—it’s a vital, living barrier that adapts and evolves to keep us safe.

{"text": "LETTER FROM THE AUTHOR NEWS & INFORMATION A chaotic year ahead. Imagine the news and information ecosystem as a duck swimming on a lake. There was an appearance of serenity last year, as news organizations doubled down on familiar strategies to keep the water placid. Yet just beneath that calm veneer was furious paddling as journalists raced to find applications of generative AI that could keep the industry stable. In 2025, a combination of technologies, regulations, and the political climate will shatter that calm like a hunter with a twelve-gauge shotgun—spooking the duck, sending ripples across the lake, and forcibly creating a new reality. The technologies that started to transform the information economy last year will keep maturing. Consumers will encounter synthetic media in more places, and advances in generated images and videos will make it even Sam Guzik harder to determine what is real: expect to see at least one major publisher fooled by an AI-generated hoax in News and Information Lead the coming months. Publishers will keep fighting with tech companies about the value of their content, even as search engines and device manufacturers duke it out for a dominant position in the shifting landscape for content discovery—a fight that will almost certainly leave publishers with a weaker competitive position than before. But none of that is new; the real change in 2025 will be a brutal regulatory and political environment. If Congress repeals Section 230, it might make hosting companies think twice about providing services to aggressive investigative news outlets. We will see newsmakers file more lawsuits to punish or intimidate journalists who publish adversarial reporting. All of this will happen as our dominant social networks divest from content moderation, leaving users vulnerable to coordinated misinformation campaigns and toxic content. The litany of threats facing the news ecosystem is dire—its collapse would have deep economic ramifications and would upend our civic life. But recognizing the stark reality ahead of us is a step toward choosing a different future. Let 2025 be the year we turn our backs on dated strategies and choose to invest in reinventing our information infrastructure. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

But while there is great enthusiasm for AI, the technology’s biggest economic impact has been an infusion of cash to large-scale publishers like Axel Springer, the Associated Press, and Hearst Newspapers. All three were among the news organizations that entered into content licensing agreements with tech giants like OpenAl; the long-term wisdom of those arrangements remains uncertain. A more fundamental disruption looms in how AI might supplant the media’s traditional role in building communities and social cohesion. As AI systems become more sophisticated at delivering personalized, contextual information and engaging in natural dialogue, they could satisfy some of the need for connection that news organizations have historically met. This shift is particularly significant given the already fragile state of local community bonds, declining trust in legacy media, and the migration of social discourse to online spaces. While the implications of that change unfold, news leaders may need to reconsider the function and value of their organizations in a world where people are increasingly unmoored from their communities and lack interpersonal bonds with each other. The power dynamics between tech companies and creators will keep evolving. Publishers may gain more leverage as tech giants search for up-to-date, high-quality content to advance state- of-the-art frontier models. However, newsrooms will need to carefully consider their strategic direction to balance the potential benefits of short-term licensing revenue against the risks of dependency on technology platforms. Regardless of how they proceed, the ultimate challenge for media organizations will be maintaining their essential role in fostering informed communities while adapting to an increasingly AI-mediated information landscape. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "NEWS & INFORMATION SCENARIO YEAR 2029 ALGORITHMIC FACT-CHECKING GETS HIJACKED Wherever people gather to share news and information, algorithmic fact-checking is ubiquitous. News feeds automatically reduce the distribution of stories that fail real-time verification tests. Messaging apps run fact-checking algorithms locally to detect and flag misinformation in group chats and direct messages without compromising encrypted communications. On-device AI agents validate information before summarizing it for consumers. As a result, people generally trust the news they see; they are accustomed to seeing reliability scores and green check marks across platforms. The quality of civic discourse is improved because people can get immediate fact-checks during conversations and casual encounters through wearables. This trust came from years of work: News organizations, researchers, and tech companies worked together to build sophisticated algorithms that grasp reporting nuances. But even though misinformation is rare, this future is dark. Investigative reporting languishes because the algorithms routinely block controversial stories. Because journalists were focused on building systems to detect the kinds of misinformation that was rampant when fact-checking systems were developing in the mid-2020s, they failed to consider other inputs to the algorithms. And because the open-source tools that became the backbone of the information ecosystem were built by government-funded researchers, the algorithms subtly reject information that challenges official narratives. The tools built to help people trust what they see threaten the truth. As the world grapples with this crisis, one question looms: Who will fact-check the fact-checkers? © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "NEWS & INFORMATION SCENARIO YEAR 2026 WEAPONIZING THE DIGITAL REVENUE STACK For years, Teen Chic’s revitalization as a digital-only publication was a rare bright spot in the US magazine publishing industry. The magazine became a destination for political journalism during the first Trump administration because its leadership team realized that readers in Generations Z and Alpha saw themselves as activists—and expected the same from the brands they followed. Teen Chic engaged honestly and authentically with social justice movements, activists, and progressive politics; that coverage helped it grow a digital audience and a sustainable advertising-supported business model. In the run-up to the 2026 midterm elections, however, the magazine’s voice has become a liability. After publishing a major investigative report about how abortion access has been curtailed since the Dobbs decision, Teen Chic’s revenue cratered. The magazine finds itself struggling to monetize its content because its website isn’t listed as brand safe on programmatic ad exchanges and YouTube suspended it from video monetization programs. The changes were the result of a coordinated campaign by the Trump administration to pressure the tech companies that enable digital monetization to silence their critics. The campaign culminated with a disastrous fourth quarter, usually a high-point for ad supported publishers. As the losses mount, it’s publisher decides to shutter Teen Chic to protect its relationships with advertisers at other titles. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "NEWS & INFORMATION SCENARIO YEAR 2031 BROADCAST IS THE FUTURE The internet is mostly over-run with low-quality AI-generated media. Even as search engines and digital assistants try to sift through the vast volumes of content generated every day, consumers spend less time browsing because it is unpleasant—if not impossible—to find what they’re looking for. As the internet became less reliable, innovators spent more time thinking about broadcast. Widespread adoption of the ATSC 3.0 standard revitalized the legacy broadcast network, enabling the delivery of all types of media directly to consumers. Nearly every electronic device comes with a built-in ATSC 3.0 receiver, constantly picking up datacast signals. The volume of text, video, and audio transmitted across the airwaves is impossible for any individual to sort through. But datacasted information is perceived as more reliable than media published to the internet for two reasons: First, the cost of broadcasting establishes a significant barrier to entry, making it economically infeasible for low-value publishers to distribute content that way. Second, on-device AI models constantly curate broadcast data, creating a personalized stream of news and information that is easier for consumers to manage. The resurgence of broadcast distribution fuels investment in television stations that have the bandwidth to broadcast across a region. It also opens the door for new regulation of media because the government owns the airwaves. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

This year marks a pivotal shift in health care’s competitive landscape, with technological advancement catalyzing new business models and redefining traditional market boundaries. As industry giants like Google and Microsoft deepen their health care presence, they’re not just bringing technology; they’re fundamentally reshaping how care is delivered, accessed, and monetized. Big Tech’s deepened role has accelerated the adoption of AI-driven diagnostics, cloud health platforms, and wearable technology. AI has evolved beyond administrative efficiency to enable new care delivery models, with generative AI transforming everything from clinical documentation to real- time decision support. Simultaneously, improvements in electronic health record interoperability have made data sharing seamless while reducing errors. Telemedicine, combined with remote patient monitoring, has become essential in chronic disease management and is expanding care access globally.Amy Webb Chief Executive Officer We’re also witnessing breakthrough developments in emerging diagnostics and treatment capabilities that are creating new centers of value. CRISPR-based diagnostics and liquid biopsies could revolutionize early detection programs, particularly in oncology. Meanwhile, continued research into in-womb therapies and nanotechnology will enable innovative treatments of genetic disorders. The development of advanced implants and prosthetics, such as bioresorbable devices and brain-computer interfaces, will one day help patients regain mobility and recover quicker.The FDA has already started to approve clinical trials. As health care enters this new era, success will depend on the ability to adapt to a rapidly evolving competitive landscape where traditional boundaries between payers, providers, and technology companies become fuzzy. With AI accelerating both research and care delivery, and precision medicine moving into the mainstream, 2025 should see the emergence of new business models that challenge conventional approaches to health care. The organizations that thrive will be those that can navigate this transformation while building sustainable competitive advantages in an increasingly dynamic market. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "HEALTH CARE & MEDICINE SCENARIO YEAR 2050 A DAY IN THE LIFE The year is 2050 and health data, diagnostics and personalized care are baked into our days, no matter where you are. The convergence of personalized medicine, quantum computing, alternative materials and advanced biotech means cutting-edge technology is constantly improving the health of even those living in rural areas, far away from a brick-and-mortar medical center. It starts from the moment you wake up: through the night, a nanotech-powered biosensor embedded in your clothing and bedsheets has been continuously monitoring vitals like blood pressure, glucose and even stress markers. These biosensors, made from nanoscale materials and seamlessly integrated into everyday fabrics, are capable of detecting and measuring biological data at the molecular level. When the day starts, the sensors compile your data and transmit it to the AI-driven health assistant through your home’s neural hub, an advanced interface that connects all your wearable devices, AI systems, and home sensors. Before breakfast is done, the AI health assistant has already suggested some dietary tweaks based on real-time metabolic analysis. It syncs with the personalized nanobot that’s been implanted into your thigh, and tells it to adjust the microdoses of vitamins and medications it’s releasing directly into your bloodstream. If there’s something amiss, no need to worry: the AI will go ahead and schedule a virtual checkup with a global care network specialist without even being prompted. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

The pod performs a full-body scan using terahertz imaging, a revolutionary technique that deploys non-ionizing radiation to penetrate tissues and provide detailed internal images without harmful X-rays. Terahertz waves offer highly precise imaging, revealing abnormalities in skin, tissues, and even cell-level changes. Additionally, the pod conducts a blood analysis through a noninvasive spectrometry interface. It cross-references your results with a blockchain-secured global health database, recommending personalized health trends and optimizing preventive care protocols. If something more is needed, a built-in 3D bioprinter stands ready to create personalized medication or tissue grafts.

{"text": "HEALTH CARE & MEDICINE SCENARIO YEAR 2040 THE BIOTECH REBELLION The allure of genetic enhancement and personalized biotech has established a dark undercurrent in global health care. Driven by the promise of engineered perfection—enhanced intelligence, strength, and immunity—individuals are seeking unregulated genetic modifications as mainstream biotech companies struggle to keep up with demand. Rogue biohacking communities, once niche groups experimenting in garages, have expanded into an underground industry, offering back-alley CRISPR modifications and black-market implants. The appeal is undeniable: Why wait for government-approved procedures when you can fast-track your evolution? Yet, the consequences of these DIY procedures are unpredictable and catastrophic. In unmonitored labs and secret clinics, genetic experiments go awry. Early adopters of unregulated biotech soon face devastating repercussions—mutations spread across cellular structures, causing organ failure, accelerated aging, and aggressive cancers. Augmentations intended to enhance intelligence lead to severe neurological conditions. The impact ripples through society as hospitals, overwhelmed by biohacking injuries, are unequipped to treat novel, genetically modified diseases. Communities fracture as those with failed augmentations demand restitution and treatment while governments, caught off guard, are slow to respond. The health care system—already burdened by aging populations and chronic disease—collapses under the weight of the biotech rebellion. As chaos mounts, regulatory bodies scramble to contain the crisis. Attempts to shut down rogue labs and enforce stricter biotech laws lead to protests, and biohackers claim their right to self-determination. Some regions, unable to enforce regulations, become biotech wastelands where genetic experimentation continues unchecked. Trust in mainstream health care plummets, and legitimate biotech research grinds to a halt as public fear of genetic modification escalates. What was once seen as the next frontier of human progress is now a battlefield—one where the consequences of unchecked ambition threaten the very fabric of society. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "HEALTH CARE & MEDICINE SCENARIO YEAR 2032 THE HEALTH CAPSULE The overwhelming influx of data from wearables and AI-powered health platforms has reached a critical point, leaving both patients and health care providers buried in endless streams of information. With continuous tracking of everything from heart rates to stress levels, patients are anxious, unsure how to interpret fluctuating metrics. Doctors, too, struggle to prioritize relevant data, leading to burnout and delayed care. The sheer volume of health information—meant to improve outcomes—has instead created confusion, inefficiency, and mistrust in health technologies. Enter the Health Capsule. This small, e-ink device distills the flood of data into a personalized, minimalist format that both patients and providers can easily understand. Rather than tracking every minor fluctuation, the Health Capsule gives patients simple daily summaries—like “low energy” or “good sleep”—while its AI filters out irrelevant data from wearables, identifying only the most important patterns. It provides a clear, concise health snapshot each day, displayed on its calming e-ink screen, offering natural language insights such as “Hydration needed” or “Steady improvement in energy.” For health care providers, the Health Capsule solves a major issue: how to manage the growing deluge of patient data without sacrificing care quality. Doctors can sync the Capsule during appointments, retrieving concise insights without being overwhelmed by raw metrics. By simplifying health data into actionable summaries, the Health Capsule restores balance, making health care manageable again for both patients and providers. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "LETTER FROM THE AUTHOR FINANCIAL SERVICES & INSURANCE Transformation efforts need to happen now—before it’s too late. The next decade will be make-or-break for companies in the financial services and insurance industry based on their ability to harness the immense amount of data available to improve efficiency, personalization, and speed. While headlines focus on the latest artificial intelligence breakthroughs, a more fundamental challenge looms larger: the capacity to build and maintain the data and computing infrastructure necessary to support these advancements at an unprecedented scale. While many companies have made strides in modernization, they’re moving too slowly compared to the rapid pace of technological change. Current efforts, though commendable, risk falling short of the rapid advancements in the tech sector. By 2030, this industry will face significant disruption from nontraditional competitors that are already integrating sophisticated financial and insurance capabilities into their offerings. To maintain industry leadership, companies must accelerate digital transformation efforts and embrace cutting-edge technologies more comprehensively. Nick Bartlett Financial Services The transformation needed in financial institutions isn’t just about upgrading systems; it demands a fundamental reimagining and Insurance Lead of operational models that will determine their relevance in the evolving financial landscape. The industry faces significant challenges—from the substantial computational demands of AI workloads to the widening skills gap in specialized infrastructure management and growing data privacy concerns—yet these hurdles also present unprecedented opportunities. Companies that successfully modernize their platforms with a focus on business strategy rather than technology alone stand to gain improved customer experiences, enhanced data analytics capabilities, and greater regulatory agility. Building robust, scalable, and secure computing infrastructures will help companies maintain a competitive advantage and control of their own destiny in an increasingly digital financial world. The institutions that rise to the occasion will lead in AI adoption and actively shape the future of finance, securing their place at the forefront of the industry’s next evolution. Forward-thinking institutions that embrace comprehensive digital transformation now will be best positioned to lead as the industry becomes evermore technology-driven. The future of financial services is being written today, and it will be defined by those who take decisive, strategic action to modernize their operations and capabilities. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

Instant payments, driven by regulatory mandates and consumer demand, are positioned to replace legacy systems. This shift creates a hyperefficient transactional landscape while introducing new vulnerabilities that call for sophisticated security measures. Similarly, digital identity has evolved beyond basic authentication into a complex ecosystem of personal data and financial credentials, magnifying the importance of data privacy and cybersecurity. The insurance sector faces mounting challenges as climate-related disasters increase in frequency and severity, necessitating new risk models and coverage strategies to address escalating losses and maintain long-term solvency. Simultaneously, widespread digitalization exposes institutions to increasingly sophisticated cyberthreats, and they’ll need to shift from reactive security to proactive, intelligence-driven defense architectures. The decisions made in this period of transformation will shape not only individual institutions but the stability and inclusivity of the entire financial ecosystem.

{"text": "FINANCIAL SERVICES & INSURANCE SCENARIO YEAR 2040 SYNTHETIC OVERLOAD By 2035, financial institutions and insurers have fully transitioned to digital-first operations. Physical branches are obsolete, replaced by AI-powered virtual service hubs that handle onboarding, claims, and transactions remotely. Biometric verification and video KYC (Know Your Customer) protocols are standard, offering convenience and efficiency. However, these advancements inadvertently create fertile ground for a new threat: hyper-realistic synthetic identities. Generative AI has evolved to produce “Super Synthetic Identities,” blending stolen personal data with AI-generated biometrics, deepfake videos, and fabricated behavioral patterns. These identities are indistinguishable from real individuals, bypassing even the most advanced verification systems. Fraudsters exploit this technology to secure loans, file insurance claims, and conduct financial transactions on a massive scale. For several years, the financial system is thrown into chaos as synthetic identity fraud spirals out of control. Insurers face skyrocketing fraudulent claims supported by deepfake accident footage and fabricated medical records, driving up loss ratios and premiums. Banks are inundated with defaults on loans issued to nonexistent customers. Trust in the financial system erodes as legitimate customers bear the cost of rising fraud. Regulators step in, mandating the adoption of cryptographic identity systems tied to government-issued digital credentials. In 2040, a global “Digital Trust Initiative” emerges, albeit fragmented by region, requiring all digital interactions to be verified through secure hardware-based cryptographic keys combined with live biometric authentication. While this restores some stability, it comes at the cost of increased surveillance and reduced privacy. The financial system survives, but society is left grappling with the trade-offs between security and freedom in an era dominated by synthetic deception. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "FINANCIAL SERVICES & INSURANCE SCENARIO YEAR 2029 THE 10-SECOND PAYCHECK By 2029, the widespread adoption of instant payment systems like FedNow and RTP has transformed payroll processing in the US, enabling 90% of salaries to land in workers’ accounts within seconds of completing a shift. Gig economy platforms such as Uber and DoorDash leverage this infrastructure to disburse earnings immediately after drivers or delivery personnel finish tasks, eliminating the traditional 1–3 day payment delays. This shift is further enhanced by programmable money frameworks, inspired by India’s e-rupee model, which give employees a choice of embedding rules directly into digital currencies—for example, they can automatically divert 30% of earnings to rent payments when their daily income exceeds $500. Digital wallets like Apple’s Tap to Cash and Visa’s Flexible Credential enable workers to split funds instantly across savings, debit, or BNPL accounts, while AI-driven compliance systems (similar to J.P. Morgan’s biometric authentication) screen transactions in real time to prevent fraud. Legacy banks face existential threats as fintechs offering “smart accounts” with automated budgeting tools capture market share, while payday lenders collapse under reduced demand for cash advances. The IRS capitalizes on blockchain-based transparency to increase audits by 40%, scrutinizing previously opaque gig economy income streams. Though financial stress drops 35% due to instant liquidity access, critics highlight algorithmic biases in programmable rules— lower-income users face disproportionate compliance flags, sparking debates about fairness in automated financial systems. Policymakers respond by proposing universal basic income pilots built on FedNow’s infrastructure, testing how real-time disbursements could reshape social safety nets. Meanwhile, the EU’s Instant Payments Regulation pressures global banks to adopt similar systems, creating a ripple effect that accelerates real-time payroll adoption in markets like Brazil and Canada. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "FINANCIAL SERVICES & INSURANCE SCENARIO YEAR 2026 FINANCEEATER The Cyber Pandemic of 2026 began with a sophisticated ransomware attack on a major US health care provider in March, exploiting a previously unknown vulnerability in widely used financial software. The malware, dubbed “FinanceEater,” was designed to specifically target interconnected financial systems. Its rapid spread was facilitated by several key factors, including a zero-day exploit in popular financial transaction processing software, AI-powered adaptation that made it difficult for traditional antivirus systems to detect, and a supply chain attack that infected multiple organizations simultaneously through software updates. FinanceEater’s ability to hop from one system to another was particularly devastating. It exploited APIs used for interbank communications, allowing it to spread across different financial institutions rapidly. Once inside a system, the malware stole authentication credentials to access connected systems and partner networks. It also compromised shared cloud services used by multiple financial entities, creating a web of infection across seemingly isolated systems. Additionally, FinanceEater specifically targeted high-frequency trading platforms, using their lightning-fast connections to propagate across global stock exchanges within minutes. As the attack flourished, it paralyzed electronic trading systems, froze millions of bank accounts, and compromised sensitive financial data of countless individuals and businesses. By June 2026, more than 70% of major financial institutions worldwide had reported significant operational disruptions, leading to a temporary shutdown of stock exchanges and a global economic crisis. The cyber pandemic was finally contained in September 2026 through an unprecedented international collaboration of cybersecurity experts, government agencies, and tech giants. This collaborative effort led to the development of an AI-powered defense system capable of predicting and neutralizing FinanceEater’s evolving attack vectors in real time, finally bringing the global financial crisis under control. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "FINANCIAL SERVICES & INSURANCE SCENARIO YEAR 2030 CASCADING LIABILITIES In late 2028, a series of cyber incidents targeting logistics companies in Southeast Asia triggered a prolonged global economic challenge, exposing vulnerabilities in interconnected digital supply chains. Supply chain disruptions cascaded through industries, and business interruption and contingent business interruption claims surged, with 45% of companies reporting financial impacts from supply chain issues. The complexity of digital partnerships and blockchain-based smart contracts created scenarios of cascading liabilities that tested conventional underwriting models. Insurers struggled to adapt their policies to cover losses from unforeseen events, leading to increased litigation and reputational risks. The crisis highlighted the need for insurers to reassess risk assessment models, revise coverage terms, and develop new products to address emerging risks. As the crisis unfolded, a clear divide emerged. Companies that had invested in advanced modeling techniques to anticipate interconnectedness in the global digital ecosystem were able to mitigate their losses. These insurers had developed sophisticated risk assessment tools that accounted for digital dependencies, allowing them to adjust their underwriting practices. In contrast, insurers who continued to rely on standard underwriting practices found themselves heavily impacted. Their traditional models failed to capture the accumulating nature of risks in the interconnected digital landscape, leaving them exposed to unexpected and substantial losses. Now, in 2030, this disparity has reshaped the competitive landscape of the insurance industry. The crisis served as a powerful catalyst for innovation, pushing the entire sector toward more dynamic risk modeling and collaborative approaches to managing systemic vulnerabilities. The recent lessons learned have fundamentally transformed how insurance companies approach risk assessment and policy underwriting in the digital age. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "LETTER FROM THE AUTHOR SPACE The space industry is at an inflection point that deserves attention. Even if you’ve never thought much about rockets, satellites, or the fact that we are dangling off a rock catapulting through an ever expanding vacuum, now is the perfect time to become a space enthusiast. Space is shifting from government-driven to markets-driven. This is because of the convergence of several trends– falling launch costs, improved materials science, advanced AI, and accumulated expertise from decades of public investment. Private space activities are approaching profitability in multiple areas, which means it’s time for the government to step back. This transition from government to private enterprise is similar to what happened with the early internet; what was initially a government project later became a thriving commercial marketplace. However, this shift comes with aSam Jordan paradox: as commercial entities take over routine space operations, space itself has become more strategicallySpace Lead important than ever. The new space race isn’t just about exploration—it’s about controlling crucial orbital assets and resources that will shape global power dynamics in the 21st century. While these commercial and strategic developments are compelling on their own, space development offers something even more fundamental: optionality for humanity’s future. Even if you’re skeptical about space tourism or Mars colonies, the ability to operate beyond Earth gives us new ways to solve future challenges we can’t yet anticipate. And we’ll learn valuable lessons through the process of becoming a spacefaring civilization, too. The challenges of solving complex coordination problems and developing new institutional frameworks will force us to become better at governance and cooperation—skills that benefit humanity regardless of how space development proceeds. Even more fundamentally, space exploration expands our literal, physical reach, letting us go to new places and use new resources we couldn’t access before. Taken together, these trends matter because they represent humanity expanding its production possibility frontier. And that is worth paying attention to. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

As governments delegate responsibilities to private companies, we’re witnessing an unprecedented surge in mission frequency. This shift, coupled withshaping the future of space exploration. reusable rocket technology, has led to a dramatic reduction in launch costs, ushering in a new era of accessible and dynamic space exploration. For the space economy to flourish, it must evolve into a self-sustaining ecosystem while serving Earth’s needs. Advancements in space manufacturing, Earth observation, and extraterrestrial mining are crucial for enabling long-term missions and enhancing sustainability on our planet. AI further accelerates this progress, enabling autonomous systems that optimize operations and decision-making in space’s harsh environments. Despite the space sector’s enthusiasm, there’s a pressing need to craft compelling narratives that resonate with other industries and the general public. Illustrating space exploration’s relevance to sectors like pharmaceuticals and logistics is vital for garnering broader support and investment. By engaging diverse audiences and tailoring messages to different sectors, we can foster a deeper understanding of space’s potential benefits and open the door to a more collaborative future that bridges the economies of space and Earth. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "SPACE SCENARIO YEAR 2035 A NEW HOMESTEAD ACT As global demand for advanced batteries soars, humanity turns to the moon. Its rich deposits of lithium and rare earth elements, essential for next-gen energy storage, make lunar soil an economic gold mine—but as nations and private companies rush to establish a presence, the lack of clear governance leads to rising tensions. The US, leveraging its thriving private space sector, introduces the Lunar Homestead Act. This policy, carefully crafted to navigate the constraints of the Outer Space Treaty, doesn’t directly grant land ownership. Instead, it provides substantial financial incentives and support for US-based companies to develop lunar infrastructure and mine for resources. Under the act, companies receive funding to establish bases and extract lithium and other valuable minerals. In return, they agree to operate under US law. This clever workaround allows the US to extend its influence without explicitly claiming sovereignty, creating a de facto American presence on the moon. Tech giants and startups alike rush to stake their claims, seeing the potential to dominate the global battery market. Within years, the lunar surface will be dotted with American corporate outposts, each flying the US flag alongside their company logos. The lunar land grab doesn’t go unchallenged. China and Russia protest the US’s “lunar imperialism,” arguing that it violates the spirit of the Outer Space Treaty. The ESA, caught between its American allies and its own ambitions, proposes an international lunar authority to oversee all extraterrestrial mining activities. The situation grows more complex when a consortium of developing nations, left behind in the lunar gold rush, demands access to the moon’s resources under the principle of the “common heritage of mankind.” They propose a system where lunar wealth is shared globally, challenging the US-led capitalist model of space development. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "SPACE SCENARIO YEAR 2051 SPACE PIRATES Space-based biomanufacturing is a cornerstone of the pharmaceutical industry’s R&D, and Celestial Pharmaceuticals is at the forefront: The company operates a state-of-the-art facility in low Earth orbit (LEO), leveraging microgravity conditions to produce a revolutionary new opioid impossible to synthesize on Earth. Reusable rocket technology has dramatically lowered launch costs, democratizing access to space and paving the way for new opportunities—and challenges. Enter the Voiders, a notorious gang of space pirates, who set their sights on intercepting Celestial Pharma’s latest shipment during its descent from orbit. The Voiders launch a spacecraft cleverly disguised as a standard active debris removal system, blending seamlessly into the bustling LEO environment. This craft approaches Celestial’s cargo shuttle under the pretense of routine LEO cleanup. As they get close, the pirates execute a sophisticated cyberattack, intercepting telemetry signals that reveal critical details about the shuttle’s systems and operations. Armed with this intelligence, they hack into the propulsion system, altering the shuttle’s trajectory right after it departs from the orbital factory. Now under the pirates’ control, the unsuspecting Celestial delivery vehicle veers off course. Instead of landing at its secure destination in the Nevada desert, it is redirected to a remote site in the Sonoran Desert, where the Voiders’ ground team awaits to complete their audacious heist. The successful heist represents a pivotal moment in the space economy, compelling both companies and governments to acknowledge the harsh reality of cosmic crime and the urgent need for enhanced security protocols. As the investigation progresses, this incident acts as a wake-up call for the entire industry, igniting a new arms race between space enterprises and the pirates intent on exploiting their vulnerabilities. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "SPACE SCENARIO YEAR 2040 THE SPONTANEOUS ORDER EXPERIMENT As plans for the first permanent Mars settlement take shape, a consortium of space agencies and tech companies launches Project Ares, an ambitious experiment to test the limits of spontaneous order in extreme conditions. Project Ares is a massive multiplayer online simulation that replicates the harsh realities of Martian colonization. The game world mirrors the physical constraints of Mars: limited resources, extreme temperatures, and radiation hazards. Participants from around the world are invited to join, each taking on the role of a Mars colonist. Players must self-organize, create their own rules, and solve conflicts without external intervention. The only constraints are the physical laws of the simulated Martian environment. As the simulation progresses, fascinating patterns emerge. Players self-organize into specialized roles, develop innovative solutions to resource scarcity, and create complex social structures. However, the simulation also reveals critical failures. As the simulation concludes, researchers dissect the data, mapping the triumphs and pitfalls of this grand experiment in spontaneous order. They distill these insights into a blueprint, translating the most resilient emergent structures and ingenious solutions from the virtual Mars directly into the architectural and social framework of the impending real-world colony. The blueprint also incorporates safeguards against the failures observed in the simulation. As the first real Mars colonists prepare for their journey, they train extensively in a final version of the Project Ares simulation. This allows them to familiarize themselves with the emergent systems they’ll be using on Mars and to internalize the lessons learned from the virtual experiment. The Mars colony, when finally established, becomes a testament to the power of spontaneous order, tempered by the hard-won wisdom gained from virtual trial and error. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "SPACE SCENARIO YEAR 2050 THE BIRTH OF LUNA RODRIGUEZ At 10:17 UTC on November 15, 2050, Luna Rodriguez became the first human born off-planet. Weighing just over 6 pounds, Luna was immediately placed in a specially designed incubator to monitor her vital signs and protect her from the unique environmental factors of space. Luna’s mother, 36 weeks pregnant, went into early labor shortly after reaching orbit. Due to the challenges posed by microgravity, a C-section was performed. The procedure took place in a specially designed “surgery bubble”—a transparent, sterile enclosure that contained all necessary equipment and prevented contamination from floating bodily fluids. This bubble featured magnetic surgical tools, fabric fastener strips, and magnetic pads for organizing supplies, a “flypaper” area for suture ends, foam blocks for sharp items, and biohazard containment pockets. A complex restraint system secured the patient, surgeons, and equipment. The mother was fastened to a specialized operating table, while surgeons used waist-level restraints, foot bars, and floor-level tethers for stability and dexterity. The C-section was complicated by the behavior of organs and fluids in zero gravity, but the carefully designed environment allowed for precise control. Immediately after birth, the baby was placed in a specially designed incubator to monitor vital signs and protect against unique space environmental factors. The medical team closely monitored the newborn for any signs of developmental issues related to microgravity exposure, particularly concerning bone density, muscle development, cardiovascular system adaptation, and visual and vestibular system formation. The success of the procedure proves that human birth is possible beyond Earth, opening up new possibilities for long-term space habitation. However, it also raised questions about fetal and early childhood development in microgravity, as previous animal studies had shown some abnormalities in fetal development in space. This milestone provided crucial data for future research into space-based reproduction and early childhood development in microgravity environments that could lead to future space colonization efforts. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "LETTER FROM THE AUTHOR HOSPITALITY & RESTAURANTS Move past the back-of-house and into the future. The hospitality industry is falling behind. While a few trailblazers are redefining what’s possible with bold innovations, much of the sector is struggling to adapt, burdened by rising costs, labor shortages, and waning consumer confidence. This growing divide is holding the industry back at a time when transformation is critical. To move forward, the industry must take bold, collective action to close these gaps and embrace a more agile, innovative future. This means more than making behind-the-scenes improvements, which are valuable but insufficient to secure guest loyalty. Instead, the solution lies in focusing on visible, guest-facing innovations that create emotional connections and unforgettable experiences. Sustainability is paramount, and businesses that innovate through waste reduction, energy-efficient systems, and regenerative practices will have an advantage. But ultimately, personalization must Mark Bryan evolve beyond transactions, to offer meaningful moments that connect guests with the authenticity and culture of their Hospitality Lead destinations. In restaurants, this means going beyond a fixed menu to provide a curated tasting based on guest sustainability preferences. For hotels, it goes beyond providing rooms; instead, their curated experiences could immerse guests in local stories and create lasting impressions. To achieve this industrywide transformation, the pace of progress needs to accelerate. Advanced technologies that help businesses improve their agility—like AI-driven personalization, contactless systems, and seamless guest engagement tools—are no longer optional. Anticipating change, rather than reacting to it, will be the key to sustained success. Hospitality has always been about creating connections and memories that last. Now, more than ever, the industry must pair those values with bold innovation to build a future that is resilient, vibrant, and inclusive. The time to act is now. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

Companies that have embraced experiential travel and wellness-focused stays are thriving, as are luxurystagnation. brands that have expanded aggressively into high-growth regions such as India, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East. And direct bookings have surged, offering operators better control over pricing and deeper customer relationships. But elsewhere, the picture isn’t as rosy. In much of the world, outdated infrastructure and limited innovation in other markets are stifling growth and leaving significant opportunities untapped. The restaurant sector reflects a similar pattern of divergence. Quick-service and off-premise dining models are booming, driven by the convenience-focused behaviors of modern consumers and the essential role of delivery services. But many operators are struggling to integrate loyalty programs, streamline operations, or meet rising customer expectations. Economic pressures have forced many businesses to adopt creative pricing strategies and rethink their offerings just to stay afloat. Sustainability has become both an imperative and a challenge. Leading properties are setting the standard by adopting eco-friendly practices, such as energy-efficient systems and regenerative agriculture. However, progress is fragmented and some markets lag behind due to financial and operational constraints. For the industry to meet growing expectations for environmentally conscious options, bridging this gap is essential. Ultimately, outdated systems and resistance to innovation remain major barriers to progress in both hotels and restaurants. To overcome these challenges, businesses must prioritize targeted investments in infrastructure, streamline operations with advanced technologies, and develop flexible, forward-thinking business models. Agility and adaptability will be key to navigating external pressures, from economic uncertainty to evolving guest behaviors. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "HOSPITALITY & RESTAURANTS SCENARIO YEAR 2036 TIMELESS TRANSFERS March 2036 marks a transformative moment in luxury travel as Four Seasons unveils “Timeless Transfers,” a pioneering initiative designed to alleviate the strain of overtourism on popular cultural destinations while offering guests immersive, authentic experiences. This innovative program re-creates the essence of World Heritage Sites within Four Seasons properties worldwide by blending cutting-edge technology with deep cultural storytelling. The debut theme, Timeless Kyoto, transports guests to Japan’s historic capital through immersive experiences. For example, they could participate in a traditional tea ceremony guided by a holographic version of legendary teamaster Sadō Matsumoto digitally captured in 360-degree VR. Visitors can explore endangered culinary traditions by joining virtual cooking classes that celebrate Kyoto’s iconic Kyo-Kaiseki and shojin ryori dishes, complete with interactive storytelling about their centuries-old origins. By partnering with local artisans, employing them as cultural consultants, and dedicating a portion of proceeds to community education programs, the initiative ensures that the people and traditions of Kyoto remain at the heart of this groundbreaking concept. The “Timeless Transfers” model is as much about preservation as it is about reimagination. Four Seasons has created a platform that addresses overtourism concerns while providing sustainable support for the communities from which it draws inspiration. Through collaborations with local historians, schools, and craftspeople, the program channels resources back to cultural preservation efforts, ensuring the longevity of endangered traditions. This initiative represents a blueprint for the future of luxury tourism—one where technology bridges the gap between travelers and the world’s most cherished cultural legacies without jeopardizing their integrity. With plans for future themes such as Ancient Egypt and Renaissance Florence, Four Seasons is poised to redefine cultural engagement, making once-distant destinations—and eras—accessible while preserving their essence for generations to come. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "HOSPITALITY & RESTAURANTS SCENARIO YEAR 2034 THE EVERYDAY HOTEL AI WORKFORCE STRIKE OF 2034 In June 2034, more than 10,000 Everyday hotel workers in San Francisco are staging a citywide strike to protest the rollout of the company’s Autonomous Workforce Deployment system. The AI-driven platform, designed to dynamically allocate labor across tasks like housekeeping and front desk operations, is accused of displacing workers, reducing hours, and creating chaotic mid-shift reassignments. Employees have reported being replaced by cleaning bots and AI concierge systems without proper consultation or retraining. Union leaders have criticized Everyday for prioritizing efficiency over workforce sustainability, and demanded better protections and transition programs. The strike quickly gains support in tech-forward cities like Seattle and Boston, where automation tensions are also rising. The disruption underscores the broader conflict between technological innovation and job stability in the hospitality industry. When guest services falter under AI-only operations, local governments intervene to mediate, pushing Everyday to suspend further AI rollouts. Company officials quickly shift their priorities to invest in retraining displaced workers and implement a two-year employment buffer. The strike becomes a defining moment in 21st century labor, prompting new regulations to govern workforce automation and highlighting the importance of balancing innovation with social responsibility in an increasingly automated world. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "HOSPITALITY & RESTAURANTS SCENARIO YEAR 2044 BHOJAN NIRVANA: SAVOR WITHOUT WASTE In the heart of Mumbai, a bold new restaurant is taking the popularity of edible utensils and turning the concept into an art form. Known simply as Bhojan Nirvana, this culinary marvel has reimagined the practice of eating by blurring the lines between what you savor and what you hold in your hands. The restaurant boasts that it offers the ultimate bliss: food that includes its own utensils and doesn’t produce any waste. The innovation begins the moment your meal arrives. A creamy dal makhani is cradled in a delicately spiced bowl made entirely of lentil flour, baked to a crisp, golden perfection. The accompanying naan spoons are infused with garlic and coriander, sturdy enough to scoop every last bit of the rich, velvety dal, yet tender enough to melt in your mouth when you take the final bite. Desserts steal the show—a saffron kulfi served atop a cardamom-scented almond disc that cracks satisfyingly under a spoon made of jaggery and coconut. Bhojan Nirvana goes further by incorporating modern technology into these time- honored practices. Its edible bowls, plates, and cutlery are engineered using advanced food science to ensure sustainability, flavor harmony, and zero waste. It’s a feast for both the palate and the planet, and it might just change the way we think about food entirely. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "LETTER FROM THE AUTHOR SUPPLY CHAIN, LOGISTICS, & MANUFACTURING We need a decisive vision for a fluid supply chain future. Today’s supply chain, logistics, and manufacturing industries sit at a critical juncture, yet each industry is too focused on the near term, mostly because of geopolitical and economic crises. While these challenges are pressing and monumental, this moment—and the future—calls for more expansive thinking and adoption of new practices instead of incremental changes. In an era defined by rapid technological advancements and market evolution, our industries must transcend traditional models, by embracing a holistic and forward-thinking approach. We will have to reimagine what the supply chain looks like, and prepare for a future where self- optimizing, adaptive supply chain networks not only exist but are the norm. We won’t just see an enhancement of existing processes; we’ll experience a fundamental change in how we manage and optimize supply chains, setting a new standard for operational excellence.Mark Bryan Supply Chain Lead However, it won’t be easy, and this approach presents risks. Increased digitization and flexibility bring heightened cybersecurity threats. The complexities of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) compliance and the potential biases in AI-driven procurement processes pose significant challenges. Environmental implications from increased automation, alongside the high costs of implementing advanced tracking systems, further underscore the need for strategic and inclusive approaches. In light of these opportunities and threats, our actions must be both decisive and visionary. As we move beyond traditional limitations, we have the opportunity to transform supply chains, logistics, and manufacturing into dynamic ecosystems of innovation and resilience. By harnessing advanced technologies and fostering a culture of continuous improvement, we can lead our industries into a future that is efficient, robust, and adaptable to our rapidly changing world. This journey is about building a future that is not only sustainable but also vibrant, resilient, and full of possibility. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

Much of this movement is an attempt to keep up with ever-increasing customer fulfillment expectations—and prevent customer loyalties from wavering. Several regions are dealing with the combination of inflation, raw material shortages, and extreme weather disruptions. Fold in geopolitical tensions, and global supply chains have become incredibly complex to navigate. Conflicts in the Red Sea and Ukraine are disrupting shipping routes and upping transportation costs, pushing companies to seek alternative routes and more agile logistics solutions. Latin America faces its own set of issues—including political instability and insufficient reforms—that are hindering growth and adding to economic inefficiencies. China’s and Russia’s growing influence in the region, particularly through investments in energy and infrastructure, brings another layer of intricacy to supply chain networks. At the same time, sustainability movements and preparation for climate change impacts are keeping the industries investing for the future. In the EU, new ESG standards are spurring investments in electrification, resource management, and carbon footprint reduction, with more than 40% of companies making strides toward more sustainable operations. Despite technological advances, supply chain professionals are still spending considerable time on manual processes, including how they track data, and most don’t have a predictive view of supply and demand. The lack of visibility and real-time information hinders the balance between preparing for disruptions and properly managing inventories. To make up for it, the vast majority of supply chain executives plan to increase their investments in preparedness strategies, which will have to include better data integration. Indeed, this is a year for focusing on building resilience. Companies in the supply chain, logistics, and manufacturing sectors will be looking to diversify sourcing and invest in technology and sustainable practices, while they navigate a complex global landscape of economic volatility and geopolitical risk. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "SUPPLY CHAIN, LOGISTICS, & MANUFACTURING SCENARIO YEAR 2032 SELF-HEALING NETWORKS By 2032, the Liquid Logistics Network (LLN) has evolved into a fully self-healing, autonomous system capable of resolving disruptions without human intervention. These networks are now equipped with advanced predictive analytics and AI that monitor countless data streams— weather patterns, geopolitical shifts, market conditions, and even cyberthreats—enabling them to plan for disruptions before they occur. For instance, if a hurricane is forecasted to hit a major port, the system will reroute shipments days in advance, redirecting goods to alternate hubs and rebalancing inventory across warehouses to avoid delays. Autonomous drones and electric trucks are dispatched from nearby cities to handle overflow, ensuring that the entire supply chain continues to function seamlessly, even in the face of major logistical bottlenecks. When unexpected disruptions do occur, such as a cyberattack aimed at bringing down a key supplier’s infrastructure, the LLN’s blockchain-backed security protocols spring into action. Blockchain ensures that no critical data is lost or compromised, while smart contracts instantly trigger backup processes, like switching to secondary suppliers or rerouting shipments through safer channels. These networks have grown so advanced that they not only resolve issues in real time but also “learn” from each incident, adjusting algorithms to prevent future occurrences of the same nature. In a world where supply chains are increasingly complex and globalized, these self-healing capabilities provide companies with constant continuity, even during crises, while minimizing human intervention and optimizing for cost and sustainability. The era of reactive logistics management is over, replaced by a proactive, intelligent system that keeps the global economy flowing smoothly no matter the challenges it faces. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "SUPPLY CHAIN, LOGISTICS, & MANUFACTURING SCENARIO YEAR 2040 GESTURE PORTS It’s 2040 at Mumbai’s Smart Port, and Arjun, an immersive port operator, begins his day by activating a small wearable pin on his shirt. With a simple flick of his hand, the entire port springs to life in front of him, displaying real-time data on every ship, container, and vehicle in the port’s bustling ecosystem. The digital twin projected by Arjun’s wearable gives him full control of the port operations without the need for cumbersome equipment or physical terminals. When he swipes to the right, an autonomous crane begins lifting a container from a recently docked ship, and with a pinch-and-zoom motion, he zooms into the container details. As one of the AI-powered ships connects to the port’s electrification grid, Arjun gestures to check the status of the energy draw and cargo synchronization. The XR interface seamlessly overlays critical information, allowing him to use simple motions to make adjustments, such as rerouting cargo pickups or shifting the order of containers being unloaded to avoid congestion. Drones assist in monitoring, and smart containers adjust themselves in real-time, ensuring smooth transitions and deliveries. His wearable pin keeps the digital twin active wherever he goes, allowing him to stay connected to the port’s operations even while on the move. At the end of his shift, Arjun taps his wearable to sign off, and it automatically logs his work time. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "SUPPLY CHAIN, LOGISTICS, & MANUFACTURING SCENARIO YEAR 2028 PRINTED FIRE SUPPRESSION In 2028, on the outskirts of Stockholm, a drone swarm hovers over a river gorge to construct a lightweight, carbon-fiber bridge. The cluster of drones is part of a cutting-edge infrastructure project that is utilizing continuous additive manufacturing technology to 3D print the bridge. Each drone carries both a spool of carbon fiber and flexible energetic fibers, weaving together the intricate structure mid-air. As the drones work in synchrony, assembling the bridge section by section, an unexpected short circuit in a drone’s battery pack causes a fire to erupt in the newly laid bridge fibers. Smoke begins to rise, and the potential for catastrophic damage becomes apparent. The swarm’s energetic fibers detect the fire through embedded temperature sensors. Within seconds, they release a fire-retardant chemical embedded within their structure, snuffing out the flames before they can spread further. The drones pause their work momentarily as the fire suppression completes, ensuring no further threats remain. The flexible energetic fibers, initially developed for military purposes, now prevent the destruction of critical infrastructure, showcasing their versatility. Once the fire is extinguished, the drone swarm resumes its task, picking up where it left off. The continuous 3D printing process remains uninterrupted, thanks to the real-time adjustments and automated safety systems in place. By the end of the day, the bridge’s skeleton is complete, with only minor delays, demonstrating the powerful combination of continuous additive manufacturing and advanced safety technologies that have transformed modern construction. The project continues, now more resilient than ever, with the confidence that any future threats can be swiftly neutralized by this innovative system. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "LETTER FROM THE AUTHOR ENTERTAINMENT Entertainment today is a boundless, tech-fueled ecosystem. In her 2013 Golden Globes opening monologue, Amy Poehler joked that only there “do the beautiful people of film rub shoulders with the rat-faced people of television.” A decade later, that quip doesn’t ring so true. Meryl Streep is on Hulu, for crying out loud! Technology has leveled the entertainment playing field in such a way that the many once-distinct industries—film, television, music, gaming, sports, and performing arts, among others—have become nebulous. When all content has the potential to be high-quality and intellectual property reigns supreme, crossover is more appealing than ever to companies, creators, and consumers. As we organized this year’s book, it was clear that viewing these industries as silos no longer makes sense. To better understand the forces shaping the future of entertainment, we have to look beyond. In doing so, a larger Victoria Chaitoff structural pattern emerges. Instead of falling neatly into traditional industry categories, trends tend to cluster Director of Marketing around two key areas: the individual and the collective. The same technologies—augmented reality, extended and Communications reality, blockchain, wearables, and more—are driving both, but they’re deployed in unique ways to achieve different goals. Trends centered on the individual focus on enhancing creativity, safeguarding artistic expression, and optimizing the user experience. On the other hand, collective trends emphasize community-building, shared experiences, and societal change. This duality raises an important question: If technology can be deeply personal or inherently social, how do companies choose where to play? These two clusters may seem diametrically opposed, but in reality they’re intimately linked. Companies that successfully navigate this intersection will understand that enhancing individual experiences inevitably impacts the collective, and vice versa. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

Expect to see more collective action as individuals unite to demand better protections. Meanwhile, companies across entertainment continue to make major staff reductions. Gaming took the brunt of the reorganizations, with Microsoft laying off 1,900 gaming employees in January 2024 and another 650 in September; Twitch, Discord, Sony, Electronic Arts, and others followed suit throughout the year. Blame it, in part, on the rise of generative AI coinciding with the effects of a global pandemic—the latter spurred hiring that has been rendered superfluous as AI makes processes more efficient. Companies are taking big swings on how to use AI in public-facing capacities because they don’t want to be left behind, but few have succeeded in laying the foundation for its long-term value add; its larger impact has been in back-end optimization. The hype around AI echoes the hype around other recent “of-the-moment” areas of tech like blockchain or the metaverse. Once the buzz dies down, the hard work to realize the transformational potential of the underlying technologies begins. In the case of AI, however, that realization may be more rapid, and the potential more staggering and enduring than society expects. Overall, 2024 was about regaining balance. Strikes caused months-long delays in production, while layoffs prompted periods of realignment—all against the backdrop of the US presidential election. This year, the experimental phase of AI seems poised to give way to more purposeful integration and more structured regulatory frameworks. As entertainment companies emerge leaner and more focused, success will hinge on their ability to win back internal and external confidence. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "ENTERTAINMENT SCENARIO YEAR 2035 ENTERTAINMENT TAKES THE WHEEL As vehicles become increasingly autonomous, traditional manufacturers find themselves struggling to remain relevant in an industry where entertainment has replaced driving as the primary in-vehicle focus. Disney becomes one of the first media companies to enter the automotive space, with its purchase of longtime partner Hyundai marking a pivotal moment in the shift from cars as tools that enable travel to personalized, mobile entertainment hubs. In this future, the car is no longer a means to an end. It’s more like an immersive clubhouse, with every drive transforming into an AI-tailored experience. Gone are the days of needing separate devices. The car itself is the system. Dashboard screens, equipped for extended reality experiences, stretch from door to door and spill onto the windows. Content-aware haptic seats rotate 360 degrees. These vehicles are accessible to people across a spectrum of ages and abilities, thanks not only to self-driving technology but also their modular interiors and digital customization options. Unfortunately, it’s not all fun and games: this reality raises questions about overstimulation and perhaps even isolation. Moreover, the car is not just a vehicle—it’s also a data-collecting machine, and the content that passengers consume is deeply commercial. Where on-road advertising was once limited to radio spots and billboards, it’s now woven directly into the experience. AI generatively inserts Disney products into scenes, whether it’s subtle placements within a game or characters in films sporting “Toy Story 8” merchandise. The data Disney is collecting—everything from a passenger’s media preferences to their emotional responses to specific content—begins to inform far more than just entertainment. Car insurance companies start to factor content consumption habits into their risk assessments. A passenger who regularly indulges in high-adrenaline action movies or survival video games, for example, may find themselves paying higher premiums, their habits considered risk factors for potential accidents even in primarily autonomous vehicles. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.

{"text": "ENTERTAINMENT SCENARIO YEAR 2040 BEST SEAT IN THE HOUSE What happens when every seat is a front-row seat? Rising real estate prices and advanced immersion technologies have intersected to create digital-first entertainment experiences. Major concerts, political rallies, sporting events, and more are staged for largely virtual audiences. Real-time translation and increased 5G connectivity mean that culture is no longer bound by geography. A fan in Seoul can experience a live-streamed Taylor Swift concert in New York with the same clarity and emotional intensity as someone down the street. The in-person experience, on the other hand, becomes an extravagant luxury, accessible only to the highest-end consumer. As companies shed their physical footprints, the few remaining production facilities are relocated to strategically remote areas. Only a handful of flagship venues, often hidden away in scenic or exotic locations, remain. Attending a live event is now a monumental, often unattainable, occasion. Modular in design to allow for maximal flexibility, these venues are enhanced with haptic and interactive mixed-reality technologies. Like audiences, performers and athletes begin to travel less. The environmental impact of constant travel and maintaining large-scale physical infrastructures fades as the digital world becomes the primary arena for entertainment. But this shift comes with an interesting paradox: Companies that reduced their physical footprints now rely on enormous amounts of energy to power immersive environments and AI-driven personalized content. Companies that lead in reducing digital energy consumption and carbon emissions skyrocket in value. Soaring property values may also push people toward communal living, where they share both space and virtual experiences with like-minded individuals. Ultimately, these curated spaces have the potential to become ideological echo chambers. Despite the hyperconnectivity, people start to feel more isolated— and while the world is closer in some ways, it’s more divided in others. © 2025 Future Today Strategy Group.
