It is the intention of the Offeror to continue with the Group’s existing principal business activities. In particular, the Offeror intends to expand the existing businesses of the Group through, among others, exploring business opportunities related to artificial intelligence, digital assets and Web3.

As disclosed in the Profit Warning Announcements, the Group is expected to record a decrease in its revenue for the year ended 31 December 2024 by 75% to 85% compared to approximately RMB440.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2023. Such estimated decrease in revenue during the year ended 31 December 2024 is mainly attributable to (i) a decrease in revenue from data transmission and processing services because the Group’s clients in the IoT industry have delayed their projects taking into consideration of their concerns in cashflows and uncertainty in macroeconomic condition; and (ii) a decrease in revenue from sales of equipment due to the lack of customer demand during the year ended 31 December 2024. The aforesaid estimated decrease in revenue, together with (i) a decrease in gross margin as a result of the intensified market competition; and (ii) an increase in impairment losses on trade receivables due to slower collection, resulted in the estimated net loss position of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2024. The Loss Estimate constitutes a profit forecast for the purposes of Rule 10 of the Takeovers Code and as it is made during the Offer Period, the Company is required to comply with the requirements under Rule 10 of the Takeovers Code with respect to profit forecasts.

{"text": "LETTER FROM THE INDEPENDENT FINANCIAL ADVISER The gross profit increased to a lesser extent by 21.3% as compared to revenue growth which was primarily due to repaid growth in material costs as a result of the change in revenue structure of the Group. The gross profit margin decreased by 12.1 percentage points to approximately 29.5% for FY2022 from 41.6% for FY2021. The Group recorded a profit for the year of approximately RMB28.5 million, representing a decrease of approximately 17.1% as compared to that of approximately RMB34.4 million for FY2021. Such decrease was mainly due to increase in administrative expenses by approximately 69.8% as a result of increase in listing expenses which the Company was successfully listed on the Stock Exchange in December 2022. Without taking into account the listing expenses in FY2021 and FY2022, the adjusted profit for the year for FY2022 increased by approximately 22.2% as compared to that of FY2021. FY2023 vs FY2022 The Group recorded revenue of approximately RMB440.6 million for FY2023, representing an increase of 36.0% as compared to that of approximately RMB324.0 million for FY2022. Such increase was primarily due to the increase in revenue generated from data transmission and processing services of approximately 59.7% to RMB380.3 million in FY2023 from RMB238.1 million in FY2022. Revenue from sales of telecommunication equipment decreased by approximately 29.2% to approximately RMB58.2 million in FY2023 from approximately RMB82.2 million in FY2022, which mainly because the Group ceased the sales of vehicle mounted antennas to a Russia distributor in December 2022 to avoid uncertain and potential risks in relation to international sanctions. Despite increase in revenue of the Group, the gross profit for FY2023 decreased by 12.3% as compared to that for FY2022. The gross profit margin decreased by 10.5 percentage points to 19.0% for FY2023 from 29.5% for FY2022. Such decrease in gross profit margin is mainly attributable to (i) intensified market competition and uncertainty in macroeconomic conditions as the Group offered competitive prices to its existing customers to maintain customer relationships; (ii) the cessation of sales of vehicle mounted antennas to a Russia distributor in December 2022, which had a high gross profit margin of approximately 34.0% for FY2022; and (iii) offering a relatively low price to attract new customers, which accounted for approximately 63.6% of the total number of customers for FY2023 in order to broaden the customer base.

Such decrease was mainly due to (i) the Group’s clients in the IoT industry having delayed their projects taking into consideration of their concerns in cash flows and uncertainty in macroeconomic condition; and (ii) lack of customer demand for telecommunication equipment. The Group’s gross profit decreased by approximately 95.1% to approximately RMB1.3 million for 1H2024 from approximately RMB27.2 million for 1H2023. The Group’s gross profit margin decreased by 11.1 percentage points to approximately 4.3% for 1H2024 from approximately 15.4% for 1H2023. Such decrease in gross profit margin was mainly attributable to (i) intensified market competition and uncertainty in macroeconomic conditions; (ii) a decrease in exports of IoT antennas to the United States, which had a high gross profit margin of approximately 34.9% in the 1H2023; and (iii) offering a relatively low price to new customers, which accounted for approximately 66.7% of the total number of customers in 1H2024. The Group recorded loss for the period of approximately RMB30.7 million for 1H2024 as compared to profit for the period of approximately 10.3 million for 1H2023. The loss for the period was mainly due to (i) decrease in gross profit as mentioned above; (ii) increase in administrative expenses as a result of increase in research and development expenses and staff costs; and (iii) increase in impairment losses on financial assets as a result of the increase of the trade receivables aged over one years as at 30 June 2024 as compared to that of 31 December 2023. The industries in which the Group operates are subject to rapid technological changes and are evolving quickly in terms of technological innovation. Since the inception, the Group has continuously invested in research and development. Recently, the Group has focused on improving the 5G network services, researching and developing industrial WLAN and upgrading the Group’s self-developed centralized data platform to enhance functionality and add new features to services and products to its customers.

Such decrease was mainly due to (i) a decrease of revenue by approximately 75.0% to approximately 85.0% as a result of (a) a decrease in revenue from data transmission and processing services because the Group’s clients in the IoT industry have delayed their projects taking into consideration of their concerns in cashflows and uncertainty in macroeconomic condition; and (b) a decrease in revenue from sales of telecommunication equipment due to the lack of customer demand in 2024; (ii) a decrease in gross profit margin as a result of the intensified market competition; and (iii) an increase in impairment losses on trade receivables due to slower collection. – 38 –", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_howkingtech_com_EW0244051.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_howkingtech_com_EW0244051.pdf", "page_number": 43, "chunk_id": "www_howkingtech_com_EW0244051_p43_c1", "creationDate": "D:20250305023559Z"}}

{"text": "LETTER FROM THE INDEPENDENT FINANCIAL ADVISER According to an article entitled “Forecast for 2024: Market Size, Competitive Landscape, and Development Outlook of China’s IoT Industry” (https://bg.qianzhan.com/trends/detail/506/231128-8f903ca8.html) by QianZhan Industrial Research Institute, a leading PRC-based industry research and market consultancy institute established in 1998, the IoT industry in China is poised for rapid growth. The market size is projected to surpass RMB7.5 trillion by 2028 with a CAGR exceeding 15% from 2023 to 2028, driven by China’s emphasis on improving economic quality and living standards through the adoption of new technologies like IoT. This advancement is expected to improve industrial efficiency, smart public services and home automation. The Chinese government has played a pivotal role in fostering IoT development through key policies such as the Made in China 2025 initiative, which was implemented by the State Council of the People’s Republic of China in May 2015, and the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025), which was officially adopted by the National People’s Congress in March 2021. Made in China 2025 emphasizes the integration of IoT, artificial intelligence, and big data into smart manufacturing, driving the adoption of Industrial IoT across sectors such as automotive, electronics, and machinery. It has driven the establishment of smart factories, where IoT-enabled systems optimize production and reduce costs, while also encouraging domestic research and development investments in IoT components like sensors and chips to enhance technological self-reliance. Meanwhile, the 14th Five-Year Plan has reinforced IoT’s importance by prioritizing 5G deployment, which provides the connectivity backbone for IoT applications. The plan also supports the development of smart cities, where IoT technologies enhance urban management, transportation, and energy efficiency, contributing to sustainable urban development. These policies have fostered a thriving IoT ecosystem, enabling China to become a global leader in IoT innovation and adoption. Government funding, standardization efforts, and public-private partnerships have accelerated digital transformation across industries such as healthcare, agriculture, and logistics. Additionally, IoT applications in environmental monitoring and smart transportation align with China’s sustainability goals. In particular, the rise of smart factories and digitalized supply chains has spurred investment in private 5G networks, enabling real-time data transmission, enhanced automation, and improved operational resilience. According to the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, which is a leading research institute under the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, China’s private 5G network market is expected to reach RMB80.2 billion by 2027, growing at a remarkable CAGR of 42% in the next five years, reflecting increasing demand for high-speed, low-latency connectivity in industrial applications. – 41 –", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_howkingtech_com_EW0244051.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_howkingtech_com_EW0244051.pdf", "page_number": 46, "chunk_id": "www_howkingtech_com_EW0244051_p46_c1", "creationDate": "D:20250305023559Z"}}
{"text": "LETTER FROM THE INDEPENDENT FINANCIAL ADVISER Despite its promising outlook, the IoT industry faces several challenges. Market fragmentation and intense competition remain significant concerns. According to an article entitled “2024 IoT Industry Chain Analysis and Competitive Landscape Research Report” (https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1792647298890362713&wfr=spider&for=pc) published by chyxx.com (智研諮詢), a Chinese website that provides market research, industry analysis, and data reports across a wide range of sectors in China since 2008, the IoT industry in the PRC spans a wide range of fields, attracting a large number of participants despite its rapid growth. While companies specialize in different areas, competition within the same sector remains intense due to product similarities. As noted in the industry overview of the Group’s prospectus, Frost & Sullivan, an independent market research consultant commissioned by the Group in connection with the global offering in November 2022, there were over 30,000 players operating across various IoT ecosystem layers, from perception to application services in 2021. Technological innovation, service integration, and industry expertise are key to maintaining a competitive edge. Data security and privacy risks are also escalating, requiring companies to invest in secure data transmission, encryption, and regulatory compliance. Moreover, interoperability and standardization issues continue to hinder seamless device connectivity and integration across diverse platforms. To address this, companies are increasingly adopting cloud-based solutions and standardized protocols. Macroeconomic conditions further complicate the landscape. According to an article entitled “National Economy Witnessed Steady Progress amidst Stability with Major Development Targets Achieved Successfully in 2024”(https://www.stats.gov.cn/english/PressRelease/202501/t20250117_1958330.html) released by the National Bureau of Statistics of China, while the national economy remained stable in 2024, external challenges are mounting. Domestic demand remains weak, businesses face operational difficulties, and the economy is still facing difficulties and challenges. Reduced consumer and business spending could dampen IoT investment, particularly among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Additionally, global supply chain disruptions and escalating trade tensions may increase costs for IoT hardware components, such as semiconductors, thereby impacting profitability. As of February 2025, trade tensions between the United States and China have intensified. The U.S. recently imposed a 10% tariff on all Chinese imports, prompting China to retaliate with tariffs on U.S. goods, including a 15% duty on coal and liquefied natural gas and a 10% duty on oil and agricultural machinery, effective 10 February 2025. Export restrictions may force more businesses to shift their focus inward, the IoT industry may experience more intense competition and increased pricing pressure in the domestic market. Given the current economic climate, businesses in China are already facing challenges, including weak demand and operational difficulties, this could further influence investment in IoT solutions. – 42 –", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_howkingtech_com_EW0244051.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_howkingtech_com_EW0244051.pdf", "page_number": 47, "chunk_id": "www_howkingtech_com_EW0244051_p47_c1", "creationDate": "D:20250305023559Z"}}
{"text": "LETTER FROM THE INDEPENDENT FINANCIAL ADVISER Our view As detailed in the section “1.2 Historical Financial Information of the Group”, the Group’s financial performance has significantly deteriorated in FY2024, primarily due to weak customer demand and delays in spending. The Group’s 2024 Interim Report also highlights a high customer concentration, with its five largest customers contributing approximately 97.2% of total revenue in the first half of 2024. Any reduction in spending by these key customers could materially impact revenue, particularly in a cautious economic environment. Although the proportion of new customers increased from 63.6% in FY2023 to 66.7% in the first half of 2024, customer acquisition remains slow and challenging amid economic uncertainty. To attract new clients, the Group may need to offer competitive pricing, free trials, or flexible terms, which could further pressure margins. Considering (i) the Group’s deteriorating financial performance in FY2024, (ii) its high customer concentration, (iii) the cautious spending environment despite economic recovery, and (iv) trade tensions and the imposition of tariffs, we believe the Group’s outlook remains uncertain in the near future despite government support. 2 Information on the Purchasers 2.1 Background information of the Offeror As stated in the Letter from Lego Securities, the Offeror is an investment holding company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands with limited liability, and is directly wholly owned by Mr. Chan Chin Ching.

In particular, the Offeror intends to expand the existing businesses of the Group through, among others, exploring business opportunities related to artificial intelligence, digital assets and Web3. The convergence of IoT (existing business) and nextgen technologies (i.e. artificial intelligence, digital assets, and Web3) would create Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (“DePIN(s)”) that could potentially unlock new economies and tap into new markets geographically, i.e. outside of the PRC. DePINs enhance the interconnectivity of physical infrastructures, such as IoT devices, internet networks and cloud computing, and can be used to automate processes, manage data and ensure secure peer-to-peer interactions. It is intended that the Offeror’s expansion plan shall be achieved through seizing business opportunities including but not limited to the enablement of peer-to-peer applications that run on blockchain networks such as Ethereum, the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning, and the expansion of decentralised networks. An imminent use case of DePIN is smart cities that are adopting a Web3 strategy. The Offeror is optimistic about the convergence of IoT and Web3, which paves the way for innovative real world use cases across various industries, enhancing security, efficiency, user control and scalability. As the Company has been engaged in the businesses of provision of data transmission and processing services for IoT applications for years, the Offeror is of the view that the Company has established an extensive network and reputation in the IoT industry, and that the Offeror will be able to grow the Company’s business under its direction upon becoming the controlling Shareholder through the acquisition of the Sale Shares.

Notably, the closing price largely remained below HK$1.0 since October 2024, which, based on discussions with Management, they were not aware of any matters which caused the closing price to dip below HK$1.0. Following the Joint Announcement on the Offers, we observed a sharp increase in trading, with the closing price of the Shares surging from HK$0.82 on 17 January 2025 to HK$2.40 on 27 January 2025. The closing prices remain above the Share Offer Price of HK$0.889 as of the Latest Practicable Date. We attribute this price spike to market reactions and anticipation of favorable effects from the change in the controlling Shareholder. However, there is no guarantee that the closing price will remain above the Share Offer Price after the Latest Practicable Date or upon the close of the Share Offer. Aside from this brief spike, the overall performance of the closing prices was predominantly downward, even during periods when the Hang Seng Index was trending upwards.

Given that the historical closing prices in the Review Period have largely been traded at discounts to the NAV during the Review Period, we consider the NAV Discount to be acceptable. – 49 –", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_howkingtech_com_EW0244051.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_howkingtech_com_EW0244051.pdf", "page_number": 54, "chunk_id": "www_howkingtech_com_EW0244051_p54_c1", "creationDate": "D:20250305023559Z"}}

{"text": "LETTER FROM THE INDEPENDENT FINANCIAL ADVISER As depicted in the table above, during the Review Period, the average daily trading volume represented approximately (i) 0.0012% to 3.8391% of the total issued share capital; and (ii) 0.0026% to 12.0786% of the total number of Shares in issue held by public Shareholders at the end of the respective month. We note that the trading volume was significantly higher in January 2025 and February 2025, coinciding with the recent developments regarding the Offers, which likely stimulated investor interest and trading activities. This surge in trading liquidity on 27 January 2025 reflects market reaction and anticipation following the Joint Announcement. However, after this initial increase, trading activity has gradually declined by February 2025, although it remains relatively high compared to historical levels. There is no assurance that liquidity will continue to remain at a level equal to or above that observed after the Latest Practicable Date. In contrast, for most months in the Review Period, the average daily trading volume remained below 0.3% of the total issued share capital and below 0.80% of the total number of Shares held by public Shareholders, indicating generally low liquidity. Before the surge in trading activity in January 2025 and February 2025, trading in the Shares had been particularly thin, with an average daily trading volume of below 0.1% of the total issued share capital in most months of 2024. Notably, in August 2024 and September 2024, the average daily trading volume fell to as low as 2,727 Shares and 3,526 Shares, representing only 0.0012% and 0.0016% of the total issued share capital, respectively, and 0.0026% and 0.0034% of the total number of Shares held by public Shareholders, respectively. Given this persistently thin liquidity, it is uncertain whether Offer Shareholders who wish to exit their investment in the open market would be able to do so without depressing the market price of the Shares. Although the trading volume spiked in early 2025 following the publication of the Joint Announcement regarding the Offers, it remains uncertain whether such liquidity will be sustained in the foreseeable future. It is noted that there is a general decreasing trend in trading volume from 154,828,570 Shares on 27 January 2025 after the publication of Joint Announcement to 466,000 Shares as of the Latest Practicable Date. As such, for Offer Shareholders, particularly those holding sizeable shareholdings, the Share Offer presents a readily available exit opportunity to realize part or all of their investment in the Shares and redeploy the cash received from accepting the Share Offer into other investment opportunities, if they so choose. However, Offer Shareholders who wish to realize their investment in the Shares may consider disposing of their Shares in the open market or to potential purchasers at a price higher than the Share Offer Price. In such cases, they may decide not to accept the Share Offer but instead sell their Shares in the market or to these purchasers, depending on their individual circumstances and if the net proceeds from the sales exceed the net amount receivable under the Share Offer. – 51 –", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_howkingtech_com_EW0244051.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_howkingtech_com_EW0244051.pdf", "page_number": 56, "chunk_id": "www_howkingtech_com_EW0244051_p56_c1", "creationDate": "D:20250305023559Z"}}
{"text": "LETTER FROM THE INDEPENDENT FINANCIAL ADVISER Offer Shareholders should closely monitor the market price and liquidity of the Shares during the Offer Period and carefully assess the risks and uncertainties based on their individual risk preferences and tolerance. Those opting to retain part or all of their investment should also monitor the Group’s financial performance and the Offeror’s future intentions regarding the Company, as well as the potential challenges they may face in disposing of their Shares at the Share Offer Price after the close of the Share Offer. 3.5 Market comparable analysis In assessing the fairness and reasonableness of the Share Offer Price, we have considered the price-to-earnings ratio (the “P/E Ratio”), the price-to-book ratio (the “P/B Ratio”) and the price-to-sale ratio (the “P/S Ratio”), which are the most commonly adopted valuation benchmarks in comparing the valuation of a company’s shares. However, given that the Company is principally engaged in provision of data transmission and processing services for IoT applications, which is not an asset-based business, P/B Ratio analysis may not yield any conclusive meaning and the comparison on P/B Ratio was not adopted. To conduct a valuation benchmarking analysis, based on our search on the website of the Stock Exchange and on a best effort basis, we identified comparable companies based on the following criteria: (i) companies engaged in IT infrastructure solutions (including data transmission and processing services for IoT applications and telecommunication equipment) operating primarily in the PRC; (ii) companies with shares that were actively trading (i.e. not suspended) as at the Latest Practicable Date; (iii) companies with a market capitalisation lower than HK$1 billion; and (iv) companies that did not report net loss and/or net liabilities in their latest annual reports (the “Market Comparables”). To ensure meaningful comparison, we focused on companies with positive net asset positions, as companies with net liabilities may face going concern issues, which could distort valuation multiples. Additionally, the Group has consistently strengthened its net asset position in FY2021, FY2022, and FY2023, with auditors issuing unqualified opinions for these years, reinforcing its financial stability. Based on our screening criteria, we identified an exhaustive list of three Market Comparables. While the Market Comparables do not have identical operations to the Group, they are engaged in broader segments, including enterprise IT solutions, cloud computing, and data processing services that facilitate communication between hardware and software systems. These companies may provide a wider range of IT infrastructure, integration services, and data management solutions that support various industries, including IoT-related applications. Given the limited number of listed companies focused solely on IoT data transmission and processing, we selected Market Comparables with overlapping business models and technological capabilities, making them a reasonable benchmark for valuation purposes. – 52 –", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_howkingtech_com_EW0244051.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_howkingtech_com_EW0244051.pdf", "page_number": 57, "chunk_id": "www_howkingtech_com_EW0244051_p57_c1", "creationDate": "D:20250305023559Z"}}

Despite so, the implied P/S Ratio of the Company (based on the Share Offer Price) of approximately 0.44 times is below the median and average of the P/S Ratio of the Market Comparables and is within the range of the Market Comparables. In respect of the P/E Ratio, the P/E Ratio of the Market Comparables ranged from approximately 2.36 times to approximately 14.47 times, with a median and average of approximately 7.03 times and 7.95 times. Despite so, the implied P/E Ratio of the Company (based on the Share Offer Price) of approximately 7.68 times is above the median and close to the average of the P/E Ratio of the Market Comparables and is within the range of the Market Comparables. Despite the variations in valuation multiples among the Market Comparables, we believe they provide relevant insights into industry valuation trends and market perceptions of similar businesses. The fact that the implied P/S and P/E Ratios of the Company fall within the observed range suggests that the Share Offer Price is in line with market expectations. Given that the Market Comparables operate within the broader IT infrastructure industry rather than being identical to the Group’s business, we consider that the P/S Ratio and P/E Ratio of the Market Comparables should serve as references rather than definitive valuation indicators. 4 The Option Offer With reference to the section headed “2. Share Capital” in Appendix IV to the Composite Document, as at the Latest Practicable Date, save for the 13,376,000 outstanding Share Options granted pursuant to the Share Option Scheme, pursuant to the Share Option Scheme conferring rights to subscribe for 13,376,000 new Shares, the Company had no outstanding convertible securities, options, warrants, derivatives or any other conversion rights in issue affecting the Shares. The Company had no intention to grant any new share awards under the Share Award Scheme during the Offer Period. Given that the exercise price of the outstanding Share Options (being HK$1.56 per Share Option) is higher than the Share Offer Price, the “see-through’’ price is negative and the outstanding Share Options are deeply out of the money. We consider that the Option Offer Price of a nominal value of HK$0.0001 for the cancellation of each Option is fair and reasonable as far as the Optionholders are concerned. – 54 –", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_howkingtech_com_EW0244051.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_howkingtech_com_EW0244051.pdf", "page_number": 59, "chunk_id": "www_howkingtech_com_EW0244051_p59_c1", "creationDate": "D:20250305023559Z"}}
{"text": "LETTER FROM THE INDEPENDENT FINANCIAL ADVISER RECOMMENDATION Taking into consideration of the aforementioned principal factors and reasons, in particular, the following: (i) the significant deterioration in the financial performance of the Group for the 1H2024, which marked a shift from profit-making in 1H2023 to a loss-making position in 1H2024 despite the significant growth of the IoT industry in the PRC. Based on the Group’s Profit Warning Announcements, this downturn has persisted into the second half of 2024, indicating that its financial performance has not improved even as the industry continues to expand. While the Group was profitable from FY2021 to FY2023 and only turned loss-making in 2024, there remains uncertainty as to whether the Management will be able to restore profitability in the future; (ii) as at the Latest Practicable Date, (i) no investment or business opportunities have been identified; and (ii) the Offeror is in the course of identifying candidates for the Board and has not reached any final decision as to who will be nominated and the final composition of the Board, we are of the opinion that there remains uncertainty in the future performance of the Group; (iii) the closing prices of the Shares largely trended downward during the Review Period, only increasing significantly after the publication of the Joint Announcement and remaining above the Share Offer Price as of the Latest Practicable Date. Therefore, there is no guarantee that the Share price will remain above the Share Offer Price after the Latest Practicable Date or following the close of the Offer Period; (iv) the historical closing prices in the Review Period have largely been traded at discounts to the NAV during the Review Period; (v) the trading volume of the Shares was exceptionally thin during most of the Review Period, with a notable increase only after the publication of the Joint Announcement.

There is also a general decreasing trend in trading volume from 154,828,570 Shares on 27 January 2025 to 466,000 Shares as of the Latest Practicable Date. Consequently, it remains uncertain whether there will be sufficient liquidity in the Shares in the foreseeable future for Offer Shareholders to dispose of their Shares in the open market without negatively impacting the market price.

Accordingly, we recommend the Independent Board Committee to (1) advise the Offer Shareholders to accept the Share Offer; and (2) advise the Optionholders to accept the Option Offer.

In this connection, we would like to remind the Offer Shareholders to closely monitor the market price and liquidity of the Shares during the Offer Period and consider disposing of their Shares in the open market, where possible, instead of accepting the Share Offer, if the net proceeds from such sale of Shares would be higher than the receivable under the Share Offer, and only to accept the Share Offer if the Offer Shareholders (especially those with relatively sizeable shareholdings) encounter difficulties to dispose of their Shares in the open market due to the liquidity issue at the Share Offer Price or a price higher than the Share Offer Price. In any event, the Offer Shareholders should note that there is no guarantee that the current market price of the Shares will or will not sustain and will or will not be higher than the Share Offer Price during and after the period for the acceptance of the Share Offer.

MATERIAL CHANGE The Directors confirm that, save and except for the following, there was no material change in the financial or trading position or outlook of the Group since 31 December 2023, being the date to which the latest published audited consolidated financial statements of the Group were made up, up to and including the Latest Practicable Date. As disclosed in the interim report of the Company for the six months ended 30 June 2024, (i) the Group recorded a decrease in revenue by approximately 82.4% from approximately RMB176.7 million for the six months ended 30 June 2023 (“1H2023”) to approximately RMB31.1 million for the six months ended 30 June 2024 (“1H2024”) which was mainly due to (i) decrease in revenue from data transmission and processing services by approximately 73.4% mainly resulting from the Group’s clients in the IoT industry having delayed their projects taking into consideration of their concerns in cash flows and uncertainty in macroeconomic condition; and (ii) decrease in sales of telecommunication equipment due to lack of customer demand; (ii) the Group recorded a decrease in gross profit by approximately 95.1% from approximately RMB27.2 million for 1H2023 to approximately RMB1.3 million for 1H2024, resulting from decrease in revenue and gross profit margin. The Group’s gross profit margin decreased from approximately 15.4% for 1H2023 to approximately 4.3% for the same period in 2024. Such decrease in gross profit margin of 2024 was mainly attributable to (i) intensified market competition and uncertainty in macroeconomic conditions; (ii) a decrease in exports of IoT antennas to the United States, which had a high gross profit margin of approximately 34.9% in 1H2023; and (iii) a relatively lower cooperation price to develop new customers, the number of which accounted for approximately 66.7% of the total number of customers in the 1H2024; (iii) the Group recorded an increase in administrative expenses by approximately 86.9% from approximately RMB13.9 million for 1H2023 to approximately RMB26.0 million for 1H2024 which was mainly due to the increase in research and development expenses and staff costs; (iv) the Group recorded an increase in impairment losses on financial assets by approximately 271.2% from approximately RMB1.7 million for 1H2023 to approximately RMB6.5 million for 1H2024 mainly due to the trade receivables aged over one years as at 30 June 2024 increased by approximately 33.5% as compared to that of 31 December 2023; and – II-4 –", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_howkingtech_com_EW0244051.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_howkingtech_com_EW0244051.pdf", "page_number": 77, "chunk_id": "www_howkingtech_com_EW0244051_p77_c1", "creationDate": "D:20250305023559Z"}}

(vi) the net current assets of the Group as at 30 June 2024 decreased from approximately RMB241.2 million as at 31 December 2023 to approximately RMB217.4 million as at 30 June 2024, which primarily due to (a) decrease in trade and notes receivables from approximately RMB279.8 million as at 31 December 2023 to approximately RMB263.4 million as at 30 June 2024 as a result of decrease in revenue and increase in provision for impairment in 1H2024; (b) decrease in cash and cash equivalents from approximately RMB27.5 million as at 31 December 2023 to approximately RMB14.1 million as at 30 June 2024 resulting from the net cash used in operating activities and (c) decrease in time deposits from approximately RMB5.7 million as at 31 December 2023 to nil as at 30 June 2024. As disclosed in the Profit Warning Announcements, based on the preliminary review of the management accounts of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2024 (“FY2024”), the Group is expected to record a decrease in its revenue for FY2024 by 75% to 85% compared to approximately RMB440.6 million for the year ended 31 December 2023 and a net loss for FY2024 of RMB68.0 million to RMB83.0 million compared to a net profit of approximately RMB25.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2023. Such estimated decrease in revenue during FY2024 is mainly attributable to (i) a decrease in revenue from data transmission and processing services because the Group’s clients in the IoT industry have delayed their projects taking into consideration of their concerns in cashflows and uncertainty in macroeconomic condition; and (ii) a decrease in revenue from sales of equipment due to the lack of customer demand during FY2024. The aforesaid estimated decrease in revenue, together with (i) a decrease in gross margin as a result of the intensified market competition; (ii) an increase in impairment losses on trade receivables due to slower collection, resulted in the estimated net loss position of the Group for FY2024. According to the management accounts of the Group for FY2024, the net current assets of the Group as at 31 December 2024 further decreased as compared to that as at 30 June 2024, mainly due to decrease in cash and cash equivalents and trade and notes receivables and partially offset by decrease in trade payables. – II-5 –", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_howkingtech_com_EW0244051.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_howkingtech_com_EW0244051.pdf", "page_number": 78, "chunk_id": "www_howkingtech_com_EW0244051_p78_c1", "creationDate": "D:20250305023559Z"}}
