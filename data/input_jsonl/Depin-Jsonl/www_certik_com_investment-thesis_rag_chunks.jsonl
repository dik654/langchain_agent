Permit Phishing: Attackers exploit ERC-20 functions like “Permit” or “IncreaseAllowance”, tricking victims into unknowingly signing malicious transactions. These phishing attempts often occur through deceptive dApps or fake platforms, leading victims to grant token spending permissions. Once permissions are granted, attackers can transfer assets directly, leaving victims with no recourse. CREATE2 Abuse: CREATE2 is an Ethereum opcode allowing developers to pre-calculate the address of a smart contract before deployment. While it enables innovative functionalities like flexible contract deployment and off-chain transactions, it also introduces security risks. Attackers can generate “clean” addresses with no transaction history to bypass blacklist detection in wallets. After tricking victims into signing a transaction, they deploy malicious contracts at these addresses, enabling asset theft in an irreversible manner. This technique has seen a rise in popularity due to its ability to evade standard detection systems. Address Poisoning Scams Address poisoning scams exploit users’ reliance on their transaction history when copying wallet addresses. Attackers send small transactions using wallet addresses similar to the victim's frequently interacted addresses. These fake transactions populate the victim’s wallet history with the attacker's address, increasing the likelihood of victims mistakenly sending funds to the wrong address. While these scams are less direct, they rely on human error and social engineering to achieve their goal. Alignment with CertiK Ventures: Investing in anti-phishing tools is essential for CertiK Ventures to reinforce Web3 security and build trust in the blockchain ecosystem. Phishing attacks are among the most prevalent threats in the industry, targeting users and projects to steal assets and sensitive data.

{"text": "By supporting innovative anti-phishing solutions, CertiK Ventures not only protects end-users but also strengthens the security infrastructure of Web3, fostering safer adoption and growth for blockchain technologies. Risk Analysis: Investing in an anti-phishing tool carries inherent risks, including the possibility that the tool may not be able to detect all phishing attempts, as attackers continuously evolve their techniques. Additionally, reliance on such a tool may lead to complacency in user vigilance, potentially exposing investments to other types of cyber threats. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the tool could be impacted by frequent updates and ongoing maintenance, and there is always a risk that the tool itself could have vulnerabilities that could be exploited. Security Innovation: Decentralized Auditing Model We’ve observed some security providers adopting alternative business models, such as decentralized auditing. In our view, this approach diverges from the core objective of being a leader in security within the space for the following reasons: Quality Control and Accountability: Decentralized auditing often lacks the rigorous oversight and quality assurance that centralized teams provide, leading to inconsistent results and potentially eroding trust among users. Client Preference for Continuity: Many clients value the ability to work with the same trusted auditing team for repeat engagements. This level of personalized service is incompatible with the decentralized model's inherent anonymity and randomness. Conflict with Strategic Vision: CertiK aims to become the security standard in Web3, akin to the Big Four in traditional financial accounting. Achieving this requires a foundation of credibility, consistency, and trust—attributes that decentralization and anonymity inherently lack. Controlled Expertise: Security auditing requires a controlled group of highly skilled and credible professionals. Decentralization, which opens the process to a wide and variable pool of participants, risks undermining the reliability and integrity that clients demand. Thus, while the decentralized model has merit in other areas of Web3, such as incentivizing participation or enabling trustless interactions, it falls short in the context of providing a reliable and authoritative stamp of approval. Anonymity and inconsistency are significant weaknesses in the security space, where clients often seek the assurance of working with the same team that possesses prior knowledge of their systems.

This rich academic and technical foundation enables us to contribute not only financial support but also unparalleled expertise and mentorship, making us a strong partner for initiatives that advance blockchain education and security. Closing Thoughts Valuation Framework: In the fast-evolving field of blockchain security, traditional valuation methods often fall short due to limited benchmarks and comparable examples. CertiK Ventures addresses this challenge with a multifaceted approach that blends insights from cybersecurity with Web3-specific metrics. Our methodology considers early-stage market dynamics, technology adoption rates, and the critical role of security innovation to deliver fair and strategic valuations. Below are the key dimensions we use to assess and benchmark project potential: 1. Use Comparable Transactions Industry Multiples Cybersecurity companies provide a useful starting point for valuation comparisons. These companies are often valued using revenue multiples, with: Small-scale or early-stage companies: Typically valued at 4–8x Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR), reflecting the risk associated with growth-stage companies and their limited market presence. Larger, established firms: Valued at 8–12x ARR or higher, particularly for market leaders with strong brand recognition and sustainable revenue streams. Application in Blockchain Security While Web3 and blockchain-focused projects may not yet have comparable peers, we focus on identifying companies mature enough to provide some track record. This could include completing successful beta tests, achieving initial revenue milestones, or showcasing traction in key market segments. 2. Market Potential Key Indicators: Adoption Speed: For markets with less direct quantifiable data, adoption speed can be a proxy.

{"text": "Fast adoption of a specific security technology often reflects significant demand and potential for long-term growth. Tracking developer interest and integration rates can also signal broader market acceptance. Size of Loss: Quantifying the potential loss avoided by using the security service. For example, anti- phishing tools can demonstrate their value by preventing millions in phishing scam losses. On the other hand, technologies like fuzzing or formal verification may have less immediately tangible metrics but can still demonstrate value by preventing catastrophic exploits. 3. Customer and Revenue Metrics lCustomer Base: Metrics like the number of customers (both paid and beta users), retention rates, and customer engagement provide critical insights into a project’s viability. Retention rates are particularly important as they indicate user satisfaction and the likelihood of recurring revenue. Penetration in Key Verticals: Success in high-value verticals, such as DeFi, layer-1 ecosystems, or high-traffic NFT platforms, enhances valuation. Projects that secure adoption by industry leaders or top- tier companies demonstrate strong market credibility. Pipeline of Engagements: A healthy pipeline, evidenced by partnerships or contracts with top-tier organizations, signals strong future growth potential. The ability to penetrate competitive markets reflects the project’s competitive edge and scalability. 4. Synergy Potential Cost Savings: By identifying opportunities for operational efficiencies, we assess how a project could integrate with existing CertiK capabilities or other portfolio investments. Shared resources, such as infrastructure or engineering teams, can result in significant cost reductions. Revenue Synergies: For projects with partnership potential, we evaluate the likelihood of cross-selling opportunities, market expansion into new verticals, and enhanced pricing power through collaborative product integration. These synergies are crucial in maximizing the mutual value created through strategic alliances. For projects with M&A potential, we assess the opportunities for market expansion, cross-selling, and increased pricing power post- merger.

The uniqueness of a project’s technology can also be a differentiator in crowded markets. R&D Capabilities: A strong focus on research and development signals a company’s ability to remain innovative and adaptable. Projects with dedicated R&D teams and a track record of launching new features or products are more likely to sustain long-term competitiveness. Scalability of the Technology Beyond innovation, we assess whether the technology can be scaled across industries or integrated into existing blockchain ecosystems without significant overhead or complexity. II - Ecosystem Supports CertiK Ventures believes Web3 is more than a technological evolution—it’s a paradigm shift that empowers developers, builders, and communities, along with the ecosystems they collectively shape, to claim ownership of their digital futures. As an enthusiastic participant in this transformative journey, not merely as an investor, CertiK Ventures also aims to be partners, incubators, catalysts, and co-creators, driven by a clear vision: to accelerate this transition by equipping founders, builders, and developers within promising ecosystems with the resources and support they need to thrive. To fulfill this mission, while still acting as a rational VC in a realistic manner given the limited resources, a clear vision of the future blockchain ecosystem landscape, a well-defined profile framework of the ecosystems, and comprehensive investment and risk management methods are needed. The future will see multi-chain ecosystems. In a research paper of Vitalik’s that was published as early as 2016, he envisioned a future blockchain ecosystem shaped as “different chains for different industries - and even different chains within the same industry”. About 6 years later in 2022, although showed concern over the security of bridges, he re-emphasized his optimism about multi-chain ecosystem, as he believed it’s better for different communities to “live separately than all fight over influence on the same thing”.

{"text": "What qualifies as a good ecosystem? As discussed above, given a dynamic multi-chain ecosystem landscape, we firmly believe there is ample opportunity for existing chains to evolve and for new rising stars to emerge. Regardless of their primary applications, robust blockchain ecosystems share key attributes: they foster innovation, empower participants, and ensure sustainability while adhering to the foundational principles of decentralization and transparency. These ecosystems exhibit common strengths that make them well-suited for supporting diverse use cases and driving transformative growth across industries. Robust infrastructure is basic Although high TPS cannot be the only performance indicator, the chain needs to be scalable enough to cater to the baseline requirements. Interoperability should also be considered in the chain’s architecture, which should facilitate communication with other blockchains and eventually strengthen exposures to their user base. Security is equally important, no matter through employing robust consensus protocols, onboarding distributed nodes, adopting censorship resistance architecture, or encouraging permissionless participation to the network. Builder-friendly is a must Where there are developers, there are potential and possibilities. Builder community is the backbone of an ecosystem, and to a certain extent, can help bolster the chain’s market value growth, and vice versa. Therefore, comprehensive developer tooling is needed. We need to see well-documented SDKs, APIs, accessible frameworks and programming languages to make the life easier for existing builders as well as to help onboard new developers. Differentiation is the key All of the current leading ecosystems have at least one uniqueness that helps them secure a place in the competitive landscape. Needless to say, Bitcoin as a store of value and Ethereum as the pioneer of smart contracts in blockchain gain these two ecosystems top seats. Other chains, while inheriting fundamentals from those two, make unremitting endeavors to make innovations. For instance, both optimistic rollup layer-2, Arbitrum and Optimism employ very different technological implementations and details, each can better serve different types of applications respectively. Elsewhere, there are players like Solana, which not only came up with completely different smart contract framework, but also adopted innovative Proof of History consensus, which significantly boosts transaction speed and lowers cost, and later helps to lay a solid foundation for the meme coin blossom in its ecosystem. There are others such as Polkadot and Cosmos, both emphasize interoperability but take very different tech approaches respectively.

{"text": "Investment Insights/Framework 1. Valuations In the valuation process of Web3 projects, traditional valuation methods (e.g., DCF and Asset- Based Approach) tend to be difficult to apply. Since these projects usually lack stable cash flows in the early stages and the tokens have no public value until listed, we need to rely on experience and industry consensus for valuation. Market Approach Valuation of comparable projects: Comparing the market performance and valuation ranges of similar projects to determine the relative value of the target project. For example, metrics such as market capitalization and number of users can be examined for different projects within the same track (e.g., DeFi, NFT, infrastructure, etc.). Key Metrics User Growth: The user growth rate of a project is an important indicator for assessing its market potential. A high growth rate usually means that the program is well performing in attracting users and expanding its market share. Transaction Volume: Transaction volume can demonstrate the activity and liquidity of a program. Higher volumes are usually associated with higher market interest and user engagement. Token Economic Model: To analyze the token economic model of the project, including the issuance volume, circulation volume, and locking mechanism of the tokens, all of which may affect the supply and demand of the tokens and the market value of the tokens. Community Activity: Community support and participation of the project can be an equally significant evaluation indicator. An active community usually drives the long-term development and value of the project. Industry Consensus Industry Standards: There are usually certain industry standards for valuation of projects in different tracks. For example, valuation standards may vary for DeFi, NFT and infrastructure. Case Studies: Accumulate experience by analyzing successful and failed project cases in order to better judge the valuation level of comparable projects.

Token Release Rules: CertiK Ventures closely monitors a project's token release schedule and analyzes each project's vesting schedule to ensure that exits are made at the appropriate time to avoid price declines due to oversupply in the market. Secondary Market Availability: Evaluate the secondary trading of tokens, choosing the more liquid exchange to trade on will reduce price slippage and transaction costs, thus optimizing the exit strategy. Public Price: CertiK Ventures monitors the public price and current market price of the tokens to develop a reasonable exit timing. We conduct an in-depth analysis of the initial offering price, market performance and relative value of the tokens to ensure that gains are realized at the optimal time. Price Forecasting: We utilize technical analysis, market sentiment analysis, and fundamental analysis to forecast the future performance of the tokens. These analyses help CertiK Ventures select the best time to market in order to maximize return on investment. Market Sentiment and Macroeconomic Factors: We keep a close eye on market sentiment and macroeconomic factors (e.g., policy changes, market regulation, etc.) as they may affect the price and liquidity of the tokens. CertiK Ventures adjusts its exit strategy in a timely manner based on the market dynamics in response to market volatility. Phased Exit: To minimize risk, CertiK Ventures adopts a phased exit strategy. Disposing of tokens gradually at different price ranges, rather than dumping them altogether, allows us to lock in a portion of our profits during market fluctuations while retaining a portion of our tokens for future price increases. Catalysts Compliance will become a competitive advantage: As governments gradually tighten regulations on cryptocurrencies, compliance will become one of the key factors for project success.

{"text": "Technical Risk: The blockchain sector faces significant technical risks, as highlighted by CertiK's 2023 report. In total, $1,840,879,064 was lost across 751 security incidents, a 51% decline from $3.7 billion in 2022. Private key compromises were particularly damaging, resulting in $880,892,924 lost in just 47 incidents, despite representing only 6.3% of all incidents. Common reasons for these failures include inadequate testing, lack of skilled personnel, and poor project management. Regulatory Risk: Changes in laws and regulations can pose significant risks to projects, especially in highly regulated countries or regions. Non-compliance can lead to legal penalties and reputational damage. Financial Risk: Insufficient funding or budget overruns can jeopardize project viability. Research shows that projects that secure early-stage funding have a higher success rate compared to those that do not. For example, startups that complete a Series A round have a 50% higher chance of success than those that do not secure funding until later stages. 2. Measures Diversified Portfolio Management: Investing across various sectors can help mitigate risks. Diversification reduces the impact of a downturn in any single area.

The ultimate goal is to optimize returns for both CertiK Ventures and its partners, while maintaining a pragmatic approach to the potential contributions and outcomes of its investments. As a Builder: Evolving from Service Provider to Business Partner Half of CertiK Ventures’ capital will be allocated to a Strategic Investment batch, closely aligned with CertiK’s core focus on Web3 security and infrastructure. This allocation reflects one of the fundamental objectives behind the establishment of CertiK Ventures: transforming CertiK’s role from a service provider to a strategic business partner within the Web3 ecosystem. Through targeted investments and acquisitions, CertiK Ventures prioritizes strengthening CertiK’s market positioning and brand identity. Simultaneously, it seeks to expand and diversify the company’s value proposition across services, products, research, and innovation—first within its core security vertical and then across the broader Web3 landscape, specifically focused on giving back to the builder and developer community. The challenge lies in identifying target companies that not only address general market needs but also integrate seamlessly into CertiK’s unique narrative. Propsective investments must align with CertiK Ventures on all fronts: Team, technology, product, profit and roadmap. CertiK remains accountable to its key backers, including Binance, Coinbase, and Goldman Sachs, which necessitates a high level of diligence and strategic alignment in these partnerships and investments. Given the complexity of aligning with security-focused founders and teams, as well as the significant resources required, which will require rigorous due diligence, CertiK Ventures anticipate only executing a maximum of 2-3 investments in its first operational year. Among these, 1-2 deals may lead to potential mergers and acquisitions (M&A), contingent on favorable opportunities.

Middle-tier ecosystems: Ecosystems with specific, well-defined challenges that directly benefit from CertiK Ventures’ specialized technical and strategic support. Mature ecosystems: The majority of the portfolio, consisting of established ecosystems actively seeking financial and network resources to accelerate growth and scalability. The mature ecosystems in this portfolio are expected to generate financial returns to sustain CertiK Ventures’ operations through Q4 2025. This approach provides the necessary runway for middle- and premature-tier ecosystems to reach their full potential, delivering competitive maturity and financial returns by 2026.

{"text": "Grown with Builders: Inspiring Innovation Across Web3 The remaining quarter of CertiK Ventures’ funds is allocated to the Financial Investment batch, positioning CertiK Ventures as an active and professional investment entity rather than solely a subsidiary of CertiK. This allocation prioritizes financial engagements aimed at capitalizing on current opportunities and fostering future returns, with a clear focus on achieving measurable financial goals. While the objective of the Financial Investment batch is straightforward—maximizing returns— it demands significant agility, in-depth research, and robust networks. CertiK Ventures targets community- and consumer-focused projects that drive Web3 and cryptocurrency adoption, fostering groundbreaking innovations and broadening the reach of decentralized technologies. Our strategy focuses on gaining exposure across various sectors, enabling us to deepen our collaboration with current partner institutions and reinforce our long-term alliances within the industry. These partnerships not only support innovation but also help us to navigate the increasingly intricate regulatory landscapes across global markets. Despite the wide range of verticals and asset classes available, CertiK Ventures maintains a disciplined focus on initiatives that uphold the core principles of innovation, security, decentralization, and accountability. The success of the Financial Investment batch is designed to be highly quantifiable, with a target return on investment (ROI) of at least 140% by Q4 2025. This clear metric underscores the commitment to delivering tangible value while championing the growth and evolution of the Web3 ecosystem. Outlooks The success of CertiK Ventures’ investment strategy lies in the interconnected nature of its three investment batches, each designed to complement and enhance the others. These synergies, both within the portfolio and with CertiK itself, will be continuously cultivated as CertiK Ventures progresses. Strategic Investment represents the foundational commitments that reinforce the value of Financial Investments by fostering long-term partnerships and delivering enduring benefits to portfolio projects. Ecosystem Support targeted investments in public chains not only to fortify blockchain infrastructure but also serve as a catalyst for CertiK Ventures’ Strategic Investments, enabling the accurate and relevant expansion of products, services, and business models.
