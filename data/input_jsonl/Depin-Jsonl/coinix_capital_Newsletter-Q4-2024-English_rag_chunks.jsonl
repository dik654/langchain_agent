{"text": "29. January 2025 Market Update Q4, 2024 Crypto Market Update Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a strong Q4, surging by 46.5% to close at 92,600 USD after setting a new all-time high of 108,000 USD in December. Ethereum (ETH) also gained 37%, finishing the quarter at 3,360 USD. Compared to traditional assets such as U.S. stocks and gold, which both saw returns of 20% in 2024, BTC (+120%) and ETH (+42%) significantly outperformed. However, ETH continued to lag behind BTC, reflected in the declining ETH/BTC ratio of 0.036 (-12% QoQ). Institutional adoption of BTC as a treasury asset gained further momentum, with MicroStrategy expanding its BTC holdings to 447,470, representing 2.1% of the total supply. The company acquired an additional 1,070 BTC in Q4, achieving an impressive BTC yield of 48.0% for the quarter and 74.3% for the full year. This trend underscores BTCs growing appeal as a long-term corporate reserve asset. The stablecoin sector saw continued expansion, with the total market capitalization reaching 211.7 billion USD, a 29% increase from mid-year and a 55% rise YoY. The emergence of new stablecoins, such as Ethena’s USDe and PayPal’s PYUSD, led to a slight decline in the combined market share of USDT and USDC, now at 86%. 54.6% of all stablecoins are issued on the Ethereum blockchain and experienced a 26.2% increase in stablecoin supply in the fourth quarter, further cementing its position as the leading Layer-1 blockchain for stablecoin transactions. With major financial companies such as Stripe, Visa and PayPal, companies from the Web2 world also showed renewed interest in stablecoins. In October, the financial services provider Stripe acquired the stablecoin infrastructure start-up Bridge for over one billion US dollars, taking a significant step towards crypto. The DeFi sector demonstrated strong growth in Q4, with total value locked (TVL) rising 38% QoQ to 119 billion USD. DeFi-generated fees surged by 141% QoQ to 2.82 billion USD, with decentralized exchanges (DEXs) leading the charge. AAVE reinforced its position as the top lending protocol, with total borrowings increasing by 69.3% to 14.5 billion USD, now accounting for 59% of the lending market. AAVE also led in fee generation, earning 138 million USD in Q4, an 80% increase from the previous quarter. The re-election of Donald Trump in November had a profound impact on the crypto market, triggering a 46% surge in total market capitalization. On December 17th, the market reached a new ATH of 3.9 trillion USD, driven by increased investor confidence. Daily trading volumes also saw a substantial increase, doubling from 71 billion USD to 151 billion USD, highlighting renewed enthusiasm in the sector.", "metadata": {"source_file": "coinix_capital_Newsletter-Q4-2024-English.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/coinix_capital_Newsletter-Q4-2024-English.pdf", "page_number": 2, "chunk_id": "coinix_capital_Newsletter-Q4-2024-English_p2_c1", "creationDate": "D:20250129114428Z00'00'"}}

January 2025 Market Update VC Investments in Blockchain and Crypto – Q4 2024 In Q4 2024, venture capital investments in the blockchain and crypto sectors totaled $3.5 billion, which equals a QoQ increase of 46%. The capital raised was spread across over 410 deals, a modest decline of 13% compared to Q3 2024. Altogether, 2024 has seen a total amount of 11.5 billion invested into crypto and blockchain startups through more than 2100 deals. Compared to 2023, the total amount raised within the crypto and blockchain sector in 2024 represents an increase of about 15%. Noteworthy, startups focused on the stablecoin sector have raised the most capital, led by Tether’s raise of 600 million USD in November. Geographically, most capital went into the United States, with startups located in the US making up 46% of funds raised in the fourth quarter. With 17%, the second most capital was allocated to startups located in Hong Kong. Until now, the historically observed correlation between BTC’sprice and VC’s capital allocation to crypto is missing. As can be seen in 2021 very clearly, when BTC’s price approached new all-time highs, capital raised within the crypto domain reached levels of 8 billion USD up to 12 billion USD in Q1 of 2022.
