As a result, the expected global GDP growth in 2022 is 3.2%, a sharp drop from ~6% in 2021. Meanwhile, the inflation growth rate continued to spike, reaching 8.8% YoY. A lot of people lost money in 2022. Some poorly managed companies went under (normal in capitalism, pre-2008). But many of the survivors are well capitalized and shipping new products. The whole macro economy had a bad year which you can see in the chart below showing that the MSCI All Country World Index of global equities has fallen about 19% this year, as well. © VIRA Ventures 2023 4", "metadata": {"source_file": "vira_ventures_VIRA-Ventures-Blockchain-Report.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/vira_ventures_VIRA-Ventures-Blockchain-Report.pdf", "page_number": 4, "chunk_id": "vira_ventures_VIRA-Ventures-Blockchain-Report_p4_c1", "title": "Blockchain Report", "creationDate": "D:20230423111725Z00'00'"}}

Both events and the subsequent fallouts produced ripple effects, which affected other players in the ecosystem, and dampened confidence in the sector.

One of them was the Merge of Ethereum. Ethereum’s Merge is widely considered one of the most anticipated crypto events last year. Successfully completed on 15 September 2022, The Merge witnessed the final step of the Ethereum blockchain’s transition to a proof-of- stake (PoS) consensus mechanism from proof-of-work (PoW). One of the positive effects of The Merge is that Ethereum’s energy consumption dropped by a whopping 99.95%, as PoS does not require the energy-intensive mining rigs of proof-of-work (PoW). Instead, PoS blockchains rely on validators to verify the transactions. The PoS Ethereum blockchain’s energy consumption is estimated to be roughly 1% of PayPal, and orders of magnitude smaller than PoW networks.

The same applies to technical improvements of Layer-1 Blockchains, such as Ethereum, which consequently provide companies, developers, community members or creators of any kind with new tools & possibilities to develop various dApps. Generally speaking, the success of a Layer 1 blockchain relies on several crucial features. These include security, scalability, decentralization, and interoperability. Security is paramount in any blockchain network, and Layer 1 blockchains achieve this through their consensus mechanisms, such as Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), and others. In 2022, some Layer 1 blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum have successfully maintained their security through their PoW/PoS consensus mechanisms. Scalability is another important feature that enables a blockchain to handle a high volume of transactions per second. Layer 1 blockchains like Ethereum are working towards achieving scalability through various layer 2 solutions & technologies such as rollups, sidechains, and Plasma. These solutions help to reduce the burden on the main blockchain, allowing it to handle more transactions. Decentralization is also critical as it ensures that no single entity controls the blockchain network. Especially Bitcoin has achieved a high degree of decentralization, making it difficult for any one entity to control the network. Finally, interoperability is an essential feature that allows different blockchain networks to communicate and interact with each other. Layer 1 blockchains like Polkadot, Cosmos, and Avalanche have made significant strides in achieving interoperability by allowing seamless communication between different blockchain networks. © VIRA Ventures 2023 7", "metadata": {"source_file": "vira_ventures_VIRA-Ventures-Blockchain-Report.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/vira_ventures_VIRA-Ventures-Blockchain-Report.pdf", "page_number": 7, "chunk_id": "vira_ventures_VIRA-Ventures-Blockchain-Report_p7_c1", "title": "Blockchain Report", "creationDate": "D:20230423111725Z00'00'"}}

From both a MVRV (calculates the difference between market and realized capitalization levels) and risk return standpoint, BTC seems a bit more attractive today. Bitcoin’s parity with gold would yield a 25x return, so there’s a lot to like in adding a 4% position in digital gold for every ounce of gold you buy.

{"text": "Liquidity cycles aren’t new — we’ve seen their power before. Global liquidity growth slowed considerably back in 2018 as financial conditions became more restrictive. The result was a sizable correction in risk assets and a prolonged bear market for the most speculative long-duration assets (like crypto). We saw a similar dynamic play out over the last 12 months, though on an even greater scale. Global liquidity cycles drive changes in asset prices. They influence the direction of global equity markets. They drive fluctuations in bond yields and credit spreads. They even have a substantial impact on the crypto market, which is why a reversal in global liquidity is one of — if not the most — important catalysts for a renewed bull market. We think whatever Bitcoins evolution will bring because of its technological feature such as censorship resistance it offers an insurance against the failure of centralized fiat currencies for relatively low cost already today, which could be a very valuable thing in the future especially considering high inflation rates.

{"text": "Blockchain Gaming & Metaverse Web3 gaming is all about giving players ownership of their in-game digital items and using tokens to create in-game economies (and potentially, game governance). Players with a stake in the game they’re playing, whether through in-game items or quasi-equity (tokens), will feel more invested in the game’s success and spend more time and money playing. If you hit critical mass amongst players, they’ll want to buy and sell items (NFTs), and an in- game economy can emerge that shifts the traditional gaming business model. Different Models • Pay-to-Play models require end-users to purchase games at a fixed cost. • Free-to-Play models are replacing Pay-to-Play and unlocking a larger customer base. Virtual goods and gaming-as-a-service are increasing the revenue upside for game developers. • Because NFTs recognize the ownership of in-game assets, they are enabling Play-and-Earn models. Games can raise capital and reward users through NFT sales and in-game rewards. Whether it’s digital only (NFTs that can be worn in games and metaverses and transferable and composable across platforms, ideally) or digital/physical hybrids (NFTs that can be redeemed for physical items, or rendered on a person in a picture or video), there is plenty of demand.

{"text": "DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is a type of organization that is run using smart contracts on a blockchain. DAOs are designed to be autonomous and decentralized, meaning that they are not controlled by any single individual or entity. Instead, they are governed by a set of rules that are encoded into the smart contracts that form the foundation of the DAO. The promise of DAOs is that they can enable organizations to operate in a more transparent and efficient manner, without the need for traditional hierarchy or central authority. Because decisions are made using pre-determined rules that are encoded in the smart contracts, there is less room for human error or bias. Additionally, because DAOs are decentralized, they are potentially more resistant to censorship and interference than traditional centralized organizations. DAOs, or Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, have the potential to be the future of governance for all kinds of operations, including enterprises, countries, and monetary systems. This is because DAOs are designed to operate on a decentralized blockchain platform, which eliminates the need for a centralized authority or intermediary to govern decision-making and value creation. This is a significant departure from traditional governance models, which rely on human interaction and decision-making. Over hundreds of years of time, fiat currencies and other forms of governance have failed because of human biases, corruption, and other factors that undermine their stability and effectiveness.

{"text": "DID (Decentralized Identity) In today's digital age, data has become one of the most valuable assets for individuals, businesses, and governments alike. However, as the amount of data being produced continues to grow exponentially, it has become increasingly difficult to ensure that the data is real and not manipulated in any way. This problem is only going to be exacerbated with the rise of AI, which has the ability to create deceptively real deep fake content at an alarming rate and at virtually no cost. Decentralized identity (DID) provides a solution and refers to a system of identity verification that is based on blockchain technology. In a DID system, individuals or organizations can create a unique digital identity that is stored on a decentralized network of computers, rather than being tied to a particular company or organization. One of the main benefits of decentralized identity is that it gives individuals more control over their personal information. In a traditional centralized identity system, an individual's identity is often tied to various pieces of personal information that are stored on servers controlled by a single company or organization. With decentralized identity, individuals can choose which pieces of information they want to share, and with whom they want to share it. But not only personal data, think of all kinds of digital content being distributed all over the internet. Imagine, for example, in a presidential election campaign, you want to form a qualified opinion of the candidates before you vote for someone, and in your research or on social media you come across a plethora of fake videos that are indistinguishable from real videos. How do you make sure which content is real and which is AI-generated fake content? There is a clear incentive for political parties to use AI and create fake videos about the competing parties in order to increase the likelihood of winning the election. Not only for this case, but generally speaking, we have to make sure that there is a censorship-resistant ledger of truth covering verified data and enabling trust among our society. © VIRA Ventures 2023 21", "metadata": {"source_file": "vira_ventures_VIRA-Ventures-Blockchain-Report.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/vira_ventures_VIRA-Ventures-Blockchain-Report.pdf", "page_number": 21, "chunk_id": "vira_ventures_VIRA-Ventures-Blockchain-Report_p21_c1", "title": "Blockchain Report", "creationDate": "D:20230423111725Z00'00'"}}
{"text": "This makes blockchains an ideal solution for ensuring the authenticity and provenance of data. By using blockchains, individuals, businesses, and governments can create a secure and transparent system for recording and sharing data. This can help to combat the problem of deep fake content and other forms of manipulated data that can be used to spread false information or harm individuals and organizations. In addition to providing security and immutability, blockchains also offer a number of other benefits for data management. They can help to reduce costs by eliminating the need for intermediaries and can improve efficiency by enabling real-time data sharing and collaboration. They can also improve transparency by providing a clear audit trail of all data transactions. In conclusion, the exponential growth of data production and deep fake content caused by AI is a significant challenge that needs to be addressed. Blockchains offer probably a unique and the only powerful solution for ensuring the authenticity and provenance of data and are poised to play an increasingly important role in data management and governance in the years to come. © VIRA Ventures 2023 22", "metadata": {"source_file": "vira_ventures_VIRA-Ventures-Blockchain-Report.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/vira_ventures_VIRA-Ventures-Blockchain-Report.pdf", "page_number": 22, "chunk_id": "vira_ventures_VIRA-Ventures-Blockchain-Report_p22_c1", "title": "Blockchain Report", "creationDate": "D:20230423111725Z00'00'"}}
{"text": "Sustainability Blockchain technology is increasingly being seen as a critical enabler of sustainability efforts around the world. Sustainability is all about creating a world that is livable for current and future generations. To achieve this, we must effective take steps to reduce our carbon footprint, protect the environment, and ensure equitable access to resources. Blockchain biospheres are industry-spanning ecosystems dedicated to solving specific sustainability needs, whether tackling sustainable approaches to global logistics trails or quantifying carbon capture and tokenizing emissions reductions of the energy sector. An effective usecase for sustainable biospheres is a blockchain-based carbon credit ecosystem. A blockchain-based carbon credit ecosystem has the potential to revolutionize the way individuals and companies participate in reducing carbon emissions. By using a token mechanism, individuals can be incentivized to behave in a more sustainable and eco-friendly way, thereby contributing to the overall reduction of carbon emissions.

{"text": "Sustainability is not a project; it must be deeply rooted in the daily habits of individuals. That is very difficult to achieve as we can see with failing political efforts. To get everyone involved in sustainable behaviour a token-incentive structure is needed that is directly integrated into the end-user applications supported by a blockchain protocol. A token mechanism operates by rewarding individuals who engage in sustainable activities such as using public transportation, reducing energy consumption, and recycling. The tokens are then stored on a blockchain, which provides a secure and transparent ledger that tracks all kind of transactions such as carbon credit transactions. This system creates a win-win situation where individuals are incentivized to adopt sustainable behaviors, and companies can purchase carbon credits to offset their emissions. By using this system, individuals can have a direct impact on the environment while being rewarded for their efforts. A blockchain-based carbon credit ecosystem has the potential to transform the way we approach sustainability and requires collective efforts to build. It provides a transparent and secure platform that can bring together individuals, companies, and governments in the fight against climate change. We believe that such a concept is an effective solution to fight climate change and that blockchain is the only way to build such biospheres through automated micropayments & smart contracts. Even though it is a big challenge and will take a while to onboard companies and build new systems and regulations around it, the urgent need for sustainability is the biggest consensus in the whole world. Blockchain & Web 3 is in its fundamental basic structure, made for such applications. © VIRA Ventures 2023 24", "metadata": {"source_file": "vira_ventures_VIRA-Ventures-Blockchain-Report.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/vira_ventures_VIRA-Ventures-Blockchain-Report.pdf", "page_number": 24, "chunk_id": "vira_ventures_VIRA-Ventures-Blockchain-Report_p24_c1", "title": "Blockchain Report", "creationDate": "D:20230423111725Z00'00'"}}
{"text": "DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure) The emergence of decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) represents a paradigm shift in the way we think about how to operate networks and presents a unique investment opportunity with significant growth potential. Traditionally, infrastructure has been built and maintained by centralized entities, such as governments or private companies. However, this model has its limitations: it can be slow, inefficient, and often fails to address the needs of local communities. Moreover, centralized infrastructure can be vulnerable to single points of failure and can be difficult to upgrade or adapt to changing circumstances. Decentralized physical infrastructure networks, on the other hand, are built and maintained by decentralized communities using blockchain technology and smart contracts. This new infrastructure model creates a trustless and permissionless environment where users have control over the infrastructure they use and can contribute to its maintenance and development. Moreover, it allows for the creation of new forms of economic activity and value creation, such as decentralized energy grids, transportation, communication, storage & compute networks. Relative to traditional forms of human & capital formation for building physical infrastructure, these permissionless and credibly-neutral protocols: • Can build infrastructure faster—in many cases 10-100x faster • Are more attuned to hyper-local market needs • Can be far more cost effective © VIRA Ventures 2023 25", "metadata": {"source_file": "vira_ventures_VIRA-Ventures-Blockchain-Report.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/vira_ventures_VIRA-Ventures-Blockchain-Report.pdf", "page_number": 25, "chunk_id": "vira_ventures_VIRA-Ventures-Blockchain-Report_p25_c1", "title": "Blockchain Report", "creationDate": "D:20230423111725Z00'00'"}}
{"text": "Throughout history, centralized capital formation has been the norm, where a single company controls the compensation of its stakeholders. However, this model is outdated in the internet age. Instead of relying on a central entity to make all the decisions, a permissionless network designed to scale and reward its most productive actors using the principles of supply and demand is more effective. In the past, small-scale operators were unable to compete with large corporations in the deployment of infrastructure such as telecommunications, electric grids, storage, computing and third-party logistics. But with the advent of proof of physical work, there is a paradigm shift in the way businesses operate and scale. Through crypto-economic protocols, individuals can coordinate their economic activities without relying on a centralized party to extract rent. This will lead to new value creations through efficient human & capital allocation giving the power back to the users. Our physical survival depends on the decentralization of hardware. The war against censorship will be fought in the cloud, and how effectively we wrest control of that infrastructure from Big Tech monopolies could be the difference, as we hang in the balance between an open internet and a global police state. Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) help bootstrap decentralized networks of physical hardware. Things like data storage, wireless internet access, cloud computing & GPU rendering require lots of capital expenditure and operational headaches, and it’s a non-trivial challenge to scale a hardware network to viability. Tokens have proven effective at catalyzing the development of these networks as they coordinate decentralized hardware investment at scale. This is a sector dominated by three of the largest and most reliable tech companies in the world – Microsoft, Google, and Amazon. That means partnerships, business development, and organic demand may be tougher to come by than other areas of crypto, and success hinges on a continuation of the trend towards greater Big Tech censorship. © VIRA Ventures 2023 26", "metadata": {"source_file": "vira_ventures_VIRA-Ventures-Blockchain-Report.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/vira_ventures_VIRA-Ventures-Blockchain-Report.pdf", "page_number": 26, "chunk_id": "vira_ventures_VIRA-Ventures-Blockchain-Report_p26_c1", "title": "Blockchain Report", "creationDate": "D:20230423111725Z00'00'"}}

{"text": "Building an Investment Thesis As you can see there are many opportunities & use-cases being developed in the blockchain space behind the scenes and where it is only a matter of time before they reach a stage of development where we use these decentralized applications in our daily lives. One could describe the development of blockchain networks, as a collective attempt to rebuild the internet on a new transparent, distributed and more equitable foundation. While this disruptive process (secular trend) takes time and is accompanied by short-term volatility (business cycles), it is crucial for investors to explore how to capture some of the accelerating value creation that is taking place. For every investor it is crucial to build their own thesis before considering investing. In our point of view an investment thesis for blockchain technology would typically focus on the potential for growth and disruption in various industries as a result of the adoption and implementation of blockchain technology. There are a few key factors to consider when developing an investment thesis for blockchain: I. Adoption and implementation: Blockchain technology is still relatively new and it is not yet widely adopted in many industries. Therefore, companies and protocols that are at the forefront of adoption and implementation of blockchain technology may be well-positioned for growth in the future. II. Use cases: Identifying specific use cases for blockchain technology where it can bring significant value, such as in supply chain management, digital identity, financial services, gaming and many more, can help to identify companies and protocols that are well-positioned to benefit from blockchain's adoption. © VIRA Ventures 2023 28", "metadata": {"source_file": "vira_ventures_VIRA-Ventures-Blockchain-Report.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/vira_ventures_VIRA-Ventures-Blockchain-Report.pdf", "page_number": 28, "chunk_id": "vira_ventures_VIRA-Ventures-Blockchain-Report_p28_c1", "title": "Blockchain Report", "creationDate": "D:20230423111725Z00'00'"}}
{"text": "III. Infrastructure: Blockchain infrastructure companies/protocols, like those providing protocols, development platforms and other foundational technology, may also provide a good investment opportunity as they are crucial for the ecosystem to function and grow. IV. Regulation: Blockchain and digital assets are still in a regulatory grey area for many countries. It is important to pay attention to any upcoming legal changes that could impact the blockchain ecosystem, and companies that are well-positioned to comply with regulations. V. Network effect: Blockchain technology relies heavily on network effects to build value. Therefore, projects and companies with a large, engaged and growing community of users and developers are more likely to be successful in the long term.
