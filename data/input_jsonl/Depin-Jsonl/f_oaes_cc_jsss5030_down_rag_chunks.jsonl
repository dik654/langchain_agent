A well- recognized approach for key management is threshold cryptography which distributes private keys to different nodes such that the whole system can tolerate a certain number of failures or corruptions. Motivated by the key manage- ment need of DApps, threshold signature has attracted widespread attention, with a number of new constructions being proposed in recent years. However, a practical one for DApps’ end users is still lacking, as existing schemes are hard to deploy due to the high cost of communication and distributed features. In this paper, we combine (2, 3)-threshold signature with the widely deployed cloud-edge-end (CEE) paradigm. We first propose the CEE key management framework which involves an end node, an edge node and a cloud node main- taining (2, 3) shares of end users’ private keys. Then, following the framework, we construct a (2, 3)-threshold elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA) scheme with provable security based on the ECDSA assumption. Com- pared with representative constructions of generalized threshold ECDSA, the new scheme is easy to deploy in appli- cations developed following the CEE framework. Additionally, it addresses share tampering and requires only three messages for distributively issuing a signature, which is lower than the best practice of (2, 2)-threshold ECDSA (four messages) that cannot tolerate tampering. © The Author(s) 2024.

Background and problem statement Advances of the blockchain technique promote the development of decentralized applications (DApps), which replace the server of traditional applications with decentralized storage[1,2]. A remarkable feature of DApps is that they return the ownership of data produced by end users to themselves, which is controlled by the server in traditional applications. One of the key technologies behind this is digital signature. A user of a DApp possesses a pair of public and private keys, where the public key is published and the private key is known only by the user. The private key is used to issue a signature for every data produced by the user in the DApp system, such that everyone can verify the signature via the public key. A well-known example of DApps is the bitcoin[3], where owning the private key is equivalent to owning all the bitcoins under an address derived from the corresponding public key. Therefore, how to securely manage and use the private key of digital signature schemes is a pivotal problem for DApps. To address this problem, a variety of software- and hardware-based approaches have been proposed, such as crypto wallets installed in users’ terminals, online crypto exchanges managing private keys on behalf of users, and so on[4]. Among various key management methods, a noteworthy technique is threshold cryp- tography which distributes the private key into multiple distributed nodes in a way that a threshold of them can collaboratively issue a signature or decrypt a ciphertext without recovering the private key. Threshold- based key management systems can tolerate a certain number of failures and corruptions, leaving the system sufficient time to recover from security instances and thereby reducing users’ losses caused by the leakage or tampering of private keys. 1.2. Related work Motivated by the key management need of DApps, threshold digital signature has attracted widespread at- tention from both academic and industrial communities. As the most widely adopted signature scheme in blockchain platforms and applications, threshold construction for elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA) signature has become a hot topic in recent years. Below we review some milestones and representa- tive constructions. To secure bitcoin wallets, in 2016, Gennaro et al.[5] proposed a threshold-optimal (EC)DSA signature scheme that requires the participation of the threshold 𝑡nodes to issue a signature. Before that, the best construc- tion[6] requires 2𝑡participants in the threshold signing phase. Instead of distributing the private key, Gennaro et al.[5] encrypted the private key through an additively homomorphic encryption scheme, and distributed the decryption key in (𝑡, 𝑛)-threshold manner. However, the threshold signing protocol involves six rounds of interactions among at least 𝑡nodes, and each round requires multiple broadcasting and peer-to-peer com- munications. Besides, their scheme does not have a specific share renewal algorithm to update all shares after a leaking or tampering attack. The first series of efficient threshold ECDSA schemes were proposed concurrently by Lindell and Nof[7] and Gennaro and Goldfeder[8] in 2018. The former uses ElGamal decryption ”in the exponent” to realize multiplicative-to-additive (MtA) share conversion which is a major building block for threshold ECDSA. The latter instantiates the MtA protocol using the additively homomorphic encryption scheme of Paillier. After the two schemes, new constructions of threshold ECDSA have been continuously proposed every year in top jour- nals and leading conferences in the field of information security and cryptography[9–12]. Till now, improving the practicability of threshold ECDSA remains a hot topic.", "metadata": {"source_file": "f_oaes_cc_jsss5030_down.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/f_oaes_cc_jsss5030_down.pdf", "page_number": 2, "chunk_id": "f_oaes_cc_jsss5030_down_p2_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241214131719+08'00'"}}

In 2017, Lindell[13] constructed an efficient (2, 2)-threshold ECDSA signature which involves threemessagesinanofflinepre-signingphasebeforethemessagearrivesandonemessageintheonlinesigning phase. Although this scheme is much more practical than common (𝑡, 𝑛) ones, it can only address the leakage problem of private key shares. Once one of the two shares is tampered with or broken, it will be unable to issue a signature anymore. Doerner et al.[14] presented a (2, 𝑛)-threshold ECDSA from ECDSA assumption in 2018. Their 2-out-of-𝑛signing protocol is run with eight messages exchanged among two nodes. This communication cost is too high for common end users of DApps. Tu et al.[15] proposed a fast two-party signature based on the combinatorial ECDSA. However, the verification operation of their scheme is different from the original ECDSA. In summary, reducing communication rounds and improving practicability are the main challenges in the area of threshold ECDSA. While (2, 2)-threshold ECDSA schemes have higher practicability compared to (𝑡, 𝑛)-threshold ones, the best construction so far still needs eight messages. Besides, (2, 2)-threshold schemes only address leakage problem of private key shares. Once one of the two shares is tampered with or broken, the two-party ECDSA will be unable to issue a signature anymore. The minimum threshold setting for addressing both leaking and tampering issues is (2, 3). 1.3. Our work This paper addresses the key management problem for end users of DApps by combining (2, 3)-threshold sig- nature with the cloud-edge-end (CEE) framework. The CEE framework originates from the Internet of Things (IoT), edge computing and cloud computing. It has eventually developed as a widely adopted framework for online computing products and services. Specifically, we present the CEE key management framework consist- ing of three protocols: the initial splitting protocol which distributes the user’s private key via (2, 3)-threshold secret sharing into three shares held by the end node, edge node and cloud respectively, the two-party signing protocol which is run by the end and edge nodes to collaboratively generate a signature without recovering the private key, and the update protocol which renews the three shares so that they are incompatible with all previous ones. Based on the CEE key management framework, we construct a concrete (2, 3)-threshold ECDSA scheme with provable security under the ECDSA assumption. To overcome the challenge of distributively computing 𝑠= 𝑟−1·(𝑒+𝑠𝑘·𝑟𝑥) mod 𝑞, where 𝑟is a secure instancefrom 𝑍𝑞, 𝑒= 𝐻(𝑚), and 𝑟𝑥= 𝑥mod 𝑞is derived from (𝑥, 𝑦) = 𝑟· 𝑃, we adopt the following strategies. To generate 𝑟𝑥in a distributed way, we run a key agreement protocol among the end and edge nodes to generate (𝑥, 𝑦) = 𝑟−1 · 𝑃= (𝑟1 · 𝑟2)−1 · 𝑃by sampling 𝑟1 in the end node and 𝑟2 in the edge node and then exchanging 𝑟−11 · 𝑃and 𝑟−12 · 𝑃. To compute 𝑠from partial signatures 𝑠1 = 𝑟1 · (𝑒+ 𝑠𝑘1 ·𝑟𝑥) and 𝑠2 = 𝑟2 · (𝑒+ 𝑠𝑘2 ·𝑟𝑥), we first convert 𝑟1 ·𝑟2 = 𝑟into 𝛼1 +𝛼2 = 𝑟via the MtA protocol, and convert the (2, 3)-threshold shares 𝑠𝑘1 and 𝑠𝑘2 of 𝑠𝑘into (2, 2)-additive shares 𝑠𝑘1ˆ and 𝑠𝑘2ˆ by multiplying them with the Lagrangian coefficients, so that each party can compute 𝑠𝑖as 𝛼𝑖· 𝑒+𝛼𝑖· 𝑠𝑘𝑖·𝑟𝑥for 𝑖= 1, 2. Then, by running the MtA protocol again, we output 𝛽1 and 𝛾1 on the end node and 𝛽2 and 𝛾2 on the edge node such that 𝛽1 + 𝛽2 = 𝛼1 · 𝑠𝑘2ˆ and 𝛾1 +𝛾2 = 𝛼2 · 𝑠𝑘1.ˆ Finally, the end node computes 𝑠1 = 𝛼1 · 𝑒+ (𝛼1 · 𝑠𝑘1ˆ + 𝛽1 +𝛾1) ·𝑟𝑥, and edge node computes 𝑠2 = 𝛼2 · 𝑒+ (𝛼2 · 𝑠𝑘2ˆ + 𝛽2 + 𝛾2) · 𝑟𝑥, which are additive shares of 𝑠. Additionally, we present an update protocol for the (2, 3)-threshold ECDSA, which is often missing in related work of threshold ECDSA. This protocol can renew all these three shares even if one of them is tampered with. To recover the tampered share, we construct a share recovery protocol based on secure multi-party computation. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows. First, the proposed CEE key management framework provides a practical pattern for securely managing and using private keys in blockchain-based applications. It addresses key management problems of DApp users and demonstrates a practical deployment", "metadata": {"source_file": "f_oaes_cc_jsss5030_down.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/f_oaes_cc_jsss5030_down.pdf", "page_number": 3, "chunk_id": "f_oaes_cc_jsss5030_down_p3_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241214131719+08'00'"}}

Second, the constructed (2, 3)-threshold ECDSA has a much lower communication cost than parallel schemes with a (2, 𝑛) threshold setting where 𝑛≥2, as it only requires three messages exchanged between the end and edge node for issuing a signature, while the best result of (2, 2)-threshold ECDSA[13] is four messages. Moreover, the (2, 3)-threshold setting can tolerate tampering on one of the private key shares, which is not achieved by the (2, 2)-threshold one. 1.4.

PRELIMINARIES This section reviews the ECDSA scheme and cryptographic tools for our design. Symbols used throughout this paper are defined in Table 1. 2.1.

It models the security by the EU-CMA security experiment in which an attacker A againstadigitalsignatureschemeplayswithachallenger C whointendstosolveadifficultproblem. Specifically, the EU-CMA security experiment is executed as follows. • Initialization. C initializes system public parameters and keys. • Queries. A queries C signatures on messages chosen at will. • Forgery. A returns a forged signature 𝜎∗on some new message 𝑚∗. A wins the experiment if 𝜎∗is a valid signature on the message 𝑚∗and a signature of 𝑚∗has not been queried in the query phase. Definition 1 (EU-CMA Security) A digital signature scheme is existentially unforgeable under chosen-message attacks if the advantage for any Probabilistic Polynomial Time (PPT) adversary A winning the EU-CMA security experiment is negligible. TheEU-CMAsecurityofECDSAhasbeenprovedbyBrown[16]. Wewilluseitasanassumptioninthesecurity proof of our (2, 3)-threshold ECDSA. 2.2. Cryptographic toolbox Below we review cryptographic tools used in our scheme. 2.2.1. Additively homomorphic encryption Additively homomorphic encryption provides an operation that produces the encryption of the sum of two numbers, given only the encryptions of the numbers. Let M be the message space, E be the ciphertext space, Z be the set of integers, and k be a security parameter. An additively homomorphic encryption scheme consists of three algorithms (KeyGen,Enc,Dec). For any pair of (𝑝𝑘, 𝑠𝑘) ←KeyGen(1k), messages 𝑚1, 𝑚2, 𝑚∈M, and integer 𝑧∈Z, there exists two group operations ⊕: E × E →E and ⊙: Z × E →E such that: • 𝑚1 + 𝑚2 = Dec𝑠𝑘(Enc𝑝𝑘(𝑚1) ⊕Enc𝑝𝑘(𝑚2)) • 𝑧· 𝑚= Dec𝑠𝑘(𝑧⊙Enc𝑝𝑘(𝑚)) The additively homomorphic encryption is used in the MtA technology (reviewed in Section 2.2.4). Existing schemes such as Paillier[17] encryption, ElGamal encryption ”in-the-exponent”[7], and linear homomorphic encryption schemes over a class group[18] are all compatible with the MtA protocol and the specific scheme of this paper. Our specific scheme will use the elliptic curve ElGamal encryption ”in-the-exponent”[17] as an instantiation of the additive homomorphic encryption. Below we briefly review the scheme: • KeyGen(1k): generates a random private key 𝑠𝑘∈𝑍𝑞and computes the public key 𝑝𝑘= 𝑠𝑘· 𝑃. • Enc𝑝𝑘(𝑚) where 𝑚∈𝑍𝑞: 1. Generate random 𝑟∈𝑍𝑞 2. Compute 𝑐1 = 𝑟· 𝑃and 𝑐2 = 𝑟· 𝑝𝑘+ 𝑚· 𝑃 3. Output 𝑐= (𝑐1, 𝑐2).", "metadata": {"source_file": "f_oaes_cc_jsss5030_down.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/f_oaes_cc_jsss5030_down.pdf", "page_number": 5, "chunk_id": "f_oaes_cc_jsss5030_down_p5_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241214131719+08'00'"}}

Note that as with other homomorphic encryption schemes, the ElGamal encryption ”in-the-exponent” also has its limitations. The decryption can only be achieved if 𝑚is relatively small, given that solving the discrete logarithm is hard. However, since our work focuses on key management of digital signatures, we simply use ElGamal encryption ”in-the-exponent” as an instantiation of additively homomorphic encryption. 2.2.2. Threshold secret sharing A (𝑡, 𝑛)-threshold secret sharing scheme (Dis,Rec) distributes a secret 𝑎0 into 𝑛shares in a way that 𝑎0 can be reconstructed from any 𝑡shares, and no information about 𝑎0 can be leaked from up to 𝑡−1 shares. We review Shamir’s secret sharing scheme over prime field (𝑍𝑞, +, ·) [19] as follows: • Dis(𝑎0, 𝑡, 𝑛): take a secret 𝑎0 ∈𝑍𝑞and a threshold setting (𝑡, 𝑛) as inputs, the dealer D: 1. Generate 𝑎1, · · · , 𝑎𝑡−1 ∈𝑍𝑞and construct a distribution polynomial 𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑎0 + 𝑎1𝑥+ · · · + 𝑎𝑡−1𝑥𝑡−1 mod 𝑞 (1) 2. For 𝑖= 1, · · · , 𝑛, compute 𝑦𝑖= 𝑓(𝑖) mod 𝑞 (2) and distribute 𝑦𝑖to participant P𝑖securely. Rigorously, 𝑦𝑖= 𝑓(𝑥𝑖) for some 𝑥𝑖. Here, we use 𝑥𝑖= 𝑖for conciseness as many leading papers do. • Rec(𝑄) where 𝑄represents a set of at least 𝑡shares: without losing generality, let 𝑄= {𝑦1, · · · , 𝑦𝑡}, and this algorithm reconstructs 𝑎0 as 𝑡∑ 𝑎0 = 𝜆𝑖𝑦𝑖 mod 𝑞 (3) 𝑖=1 where 𝑡∏ 𝑗 𝜆𝑖= (4) 𝑗−𝑖 𝑗=1,𝑗≠𝑖 2.2.3. Share renewal The share renewal protocol after the distribution of a secret updates its shares so that all previous shares are incompatible with the new ones. A representative approach is to update each share by adding a share of 0 to it. Here, we briefly review the basic share renewal protocol of Herzberg et al[20]. Suppose after the Dis(𝑎0, 𝑡, 𝑛), each participant P𝑖(𝑖= 1, · · · , 𝑛) possesses a share 𝑦𝑖. They cooperatively update their shares without the participation of a dealer as follows: 1. For 𝑖= 1, · · · , 𝑛, each P𝑖 (1) Generate 𝑏𝑖1, · · · , 𝑏𝑖,𝑡−1 ∈𝑍𝑞and construct a distribution polynomial for 0: 𝑔𝑖(𝑥) = 𝑏𝑖1𝑥+ · · · + 𝑏𝑖,𝑡−1𝑥𝑡−1 mod 𝑞 (5) (2) For 𝑗= 1, · · · , 𝑛, compute 𝑢𝑖𝑗= 𝑔𝑖( 𝑗) mod 𝑞 (6) and secretly send 𝑢𝑖𝑗to P𝑗( 𝑗≠𝑖). 2. For 𝑖= 1, · · · , 𝑛, every P𝑖updates its share 𝑦𝑖into ∑𝑛 𝑦𝑖+ 𝑢𝑗𝑖 mod 𝑞 (7) 𝑗=1", "metadata": {"source_file": "f_oaes_cc_jsss5030_down.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/f_oaes_cc_jsss5030_down.pdf", "page_number": 6, "chunk_id": "f_oaes_cc_jsss5030_down_p6_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241214131719+08'00'"}}

Multiplicative to additive share conversion The MtA protocol[10,21] converts multiplicative shares into additive ones. It is used as a building block in com- mon constructions of threshold ECDSA. Suppose party P𝑖possesses 𝑎and P𝑗possesses 𝑏, the MtA protocol outputs 𝛼for P𝑖and 𝛽for P𝑗such that 𝛼+ 𝛽= 𝑎· 𝑏, without leaking 𝑎to P𝑗and 𝑏to P𝑖.

System overview As shown in Figure 1, the CEE key management system involves three kinds of nodes: the cloud, edge, and end nodes. Their responsibilities in application scenarios are introduced as follows: • Cloud node maintains a (2, 3) share of user’s private key. It is responsible for recovery or update of the private key in case of security incidents threatening one of the other two shares in the edge and end nodes.", "metadata": {"source_file": "f_oaes_cc_jsss5030_down.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/f_oaes_cc_jsss5030_down.pdf", "page_number": 7, "chunk_id": "f_oaes_cc_jsss5030_down_p7_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241214131719+08'00'"}}
{"text": "Page 220 Zhang et al. J Surveill Secur Saf 2024;5:213-33 I http://dx.doi.org/10.20517/jsss.2024.30 In real-world applications, the cloud node can be a semi-trusted service provider that provides private key safeguarding services. • Edge node also maintains a (2, 3) share of user’s private key. It participates in the signing protocol collabo- ratively with the end node. In the real world, the edge node can be the edge server or gateway of an institute such as a company, a university, etc. Another example is the smart home scenario where the edge node can be a router that connects end devices in the home to the internet. In these cases, the edge node can be regarded as a trusted user-side device. • Endnode takes the original private key as input and distributes it into three shares. It also maintains a (2, 3) share of the private key to issue signatures collaboratively with the edge node. It is the user-side terminal interacting with the user and, thereby, is trusted. Thenumberofeachtypeofnodedependsontheneedsandrestrictionsofreal-worldapplicationenvironments. Each user may have one or more pairs of private and public keys, which again depends on the application scenario. For a pair of private and public keys (𝑠𝑘, 𝑝𝑘), a cloud node, an edge node, and an end node will be involved to securely manage the private key. Specifically, there are three protocols for the key management framework: • Initial Splitting. On input of a private key 𝑠𝑘in the end node, this protocol uses (2, 3)-threshold secret sharing to split 𝑠𝑘into three shares 𝑠𝑘1, 𝑠𝑘2, and 𝑠𝑘3 which will be securely stored in the end node, the edge node, and the cloud, respectively. • Two-Party Signing. To issue a signature, the end node initiates the two-party signing protocol with the edge node. Specifically, each node will use its private key share to generate a partial signature, and the two partial signatures will be used to construct the signature of 𝑠𝑘. • Update. The update protocol can be run periodically or after a recovery from security incidents. Theoret- ically, it can be run with any two shares, even if the third one is leaked or tampered with. Here we focus on a situation in which the cloud is not compromised, and one of the user-side devices, i.e., the edge node or end node, is compromised. The cloud is normally more powerful in terms of computing and storing capabilities than the edge and end nodes. Moreover, it is maintained by service providers with professional security managers and technicians. Therefore, it is less likely to be compromised by security incidents in practice. 3.2. Threat model and security model 3.2.1. Threat model We assume the cloud in the remote is semi-trusted, meaning it honestly follows the protocol specification but seeks to learn as much information as possible. We also assume that user-side devices, i.e., the edge and end nodes in the local area, are trusted. The cloud, edge, and end nodes may be compromised by security incidents, but they are not compromised simultaneously. Specifically, we assume at most one of them is compromised before an instance of the update protocol renews all shares. The threshold setting leaves the system sufficient time to identify and stop security incidents happening in one device before a second one is compromised. Additionally, we assume the initial splitting protocol is run in a secure environment, where security channels exist among the three nodes, and none of them is compromised.

The secure channels can be established via public-key encryption or key agreement protocol. Let A be an attacker against a (2, 3)-threshold signature scheme and C be the challenger who intends to solve a difficult problem. The (2, 3)-TEU-CMA security experiment is executed by A and C as follows: • Initialization. C initializes system public parameters, and generates a pair of public and private keys (𝑝𝑘, 𝑠𝑘) and three (2, 3)-threshold shares 𝑠𝑘1, 𝑠𝑘2, and 𝑠𝑘3 of 𝑠𝑘. The private key and its shares are kept by C. The public key and public parameters are provided to A. • Queries. – Signature queries. A submits a message 𝑚chosen at will to C and queries the signature 𝜎. – Corruption queries. A submits an index number 𝑖to C and queries 𝑠𝑘𝑖and other secret parameters related to 𝑠𝑘𝑖. • Forgery. A returns a forged signature 𝜎∗on some new message 𝑚∗that has never been submitted in the query phase. The signature query is inherited from the EU-CMA security experiment. A can make the signature queries for many times. The corruption query is introduced to formulate the adversary’s ability to corrupt a participant in the (2, 3)-threshold setting. A can make this type of query many times, but at most one such query for each batch of shares output by the initial splitting protocol or update protocol.

Assume secure channels have been established among the end node, the edge node and the cloud. The user inputs 𝑠𝑘in the end device and starts the initial splitting protocol which outputs three shares of 𝑠𝑘and a pair of public and private keys for an additively homomorphic encryption scheme as follows: 1. Split 𝑠𝑘into 𝑠𝑘1, 𝑠𝑘2, and 𝑠𝑘3 via the Dis(𝑠𝑘, 2, 3) algorithm of Shamir’s threshold secret sharing. 2. Generateapairofprivateandpublickeys (ℎ𝑠𝑘, ℎ𝑝𝑘) viatheKeyGen(1k) ofanadditivelyhomomorphic encryption scheme and publish ℎ𝑝𝑘 3. Securely send 𝑠𝑘2 to the edge node and 𝑠𝑘3 to the cloud. 3. Keep 𝑠𝑘1, ℎ𝑠𝑘in the end node and erase 𝑠𝑘, 𝑠𝑘2, 𝑠𝑘3. In addition to the three private key shares, the above protocol also outputs and publishes a pair of keys (ℎ𝑠𝑘, ℎ𝑝𝑘) which will be used for implementing additively homomorphic encryption in the MtA procedure of the two-party signing protocol. Although it is possible to reuse 𝑠𝑘1 and 𝑝𝑘1 = 𝑠𝑘1 · 𝑃for the homomorphic encryption, here we have two reasons for generating dedicated key pairs. First, the additively homomorphic encryption scheme can be one established on a different mathematical problem rather than the discrete log- arithm problem over elliptic curve groups of ECDSA, which means that (𝑠𝑘1, 𝑝𝑘1) is not a pair of keys for the homomorphic encryption scheme. Secondly, publishing 𝑝𝑘1 in the system will reduce the security of the (2, 3)-threshold ECDSA scheme. We will explain this point in detail in Section 5.2 after proving the unforge- ability of the scheme. 4.2. Two-party signing The two-party signing protocol is run jointly by the end and edge nodes to output a signature 𝜎= (𝑟𝑥, 𝑠) for a message 𝑚, where 𝑟𝑥is derived from the 𝑥coordinate of 𝑅= 𝑟· 𝑃for some randomly generated 𝑟∈𝑍𝑞, and 𝑠= 𝑟−1 · (𝑒+ 𝑠𝑘· 𝑟𝑥). In our scheme, 𝑅is established as 𝑟−11 · 𝑟−12 · 𝑃, where 𝑟1 and 𝑟2 are securely generated by the end and edge nodes. Therefore, the end and edge nodes can compute partial signatures as 𝑠𝑖= 𝑟𝑖· 𝑒+ 𝑟𝑖· 𝑠𝑘𝑖· 𝑟𝑥, 𝑖= 1, 2 (12) where 𝑟1 and 𝑟2 are (2, 2)-multiplicative shares of 𝑟−1, and 𝑠𝑘1 and 𝑠𝑘2 are (2, 3)-Shamir shares of 𝑠𝑘. However, we still cannot compute 𝑠from 𝑠1 and 𝑠2 as they are neither (2, 2)-multiplicative shares nor (2, 3)-Shamir shares of 𝑠. To construct 𝑠from 𝑠1 and 𝑠2, we need to convert 𝑠1 and 𝑠2 into additive shares of 𝑠. Specifically, we address the following three objectives in an offline pre-signing procedure before the input of 𝑚: • Converting the multiplicative shares 𝑟1 and 𝑟2 of 𝑟−1 into additive shares 𝛼1 and 𝛼2, that is, outputting 𝛼1 on the end node and 𝛼2 on the edge node such that 𝛼1 + 𝛼2 = 𝑟1 · 𝑟2 = 𝑟−1. This is addressed via the MtA protocol. • Converting the (2, 3)-threshold shares 𝑠𝑘1 and 𝑠𝑘2 of 𝑠𝑘into additive shares 𝑠𝑘1ˆ and 𝑠𝑘2,ˆ that is, outputting 𝑠𝑘1ˆ on the end node and 𝑠𝑘2ˆ on the edge node such that 𝑠𝑘1ˆ + 𝑠𝑘2ˆ = 𝑠𝑘. This is addressed by multiplying 𝑠𝑘𝑖with the Lagrange coefficient 𝜆𝑖. • Converting 𝛼1 · 𝑠𝑘2ˆ into 𝛽1 + 𝛽2 and 𝛼2 · 𝑠𝑘1ˆ into 𝛾1 + 𝛾2, where 𝛽1 and 𝛾1 are output on the end node, and 𝛽2 and 𝛾2 on the edge node. This is again realized via the MtA protocol. By addressing the three objectives above, the end node will be able to compute 𝑠1 = 𝛼1·𝑒+(𝛼1· 𝑠𝑘1+𝛽1+𝛾1)·𝑟𝑥ˆ mod 𝑞, and the edge node can compute 𝑠2 = 𝛼2 · 𝑒+ (𝛼2 · 𝑠𝑘2ˆ + 𝛽2 +𝛾2) ·𝑟𝑥mod 𝑞. Now, 𝑠1 and 𝑠2 are additive", "metadata": {"source_file": "f_oaes_cc_jsss5030_down.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/f_oaes_cc_jsss5030_down.pdf", "page_number": 10, "chunk_id": "f_oaes_cc_jsss5030_down_p10_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241214131719+08'00'"}}

In the above online signing protocol, the signature is output by the edge node. The reason is that in the real-world environment, especially the IoT scenario, usually the edge node is networking equipment such as a gateway that connects the local end nodes to remote servers by forwarding traffic between them. Even if the signature is output by the end node, the end node has to send it through the edge node to the intended application server. 4.3. Update Theupdateprotocolisinitiatedbytheuserviatheenddevice,eitherperiodicallyorafterrecoveryfromsecurity incidents. We consider the following two cases. If a share is leaked but not tampered with, then the three parties can run the share renewal protocol in Section 2.2.3 to update all three shares. If a share 𝑠𝑘𝑘(𝑘∈{1, 2} according to our system model) is tampered with, then before the share renewal protocol, the update protocol needs to recover it via the other two shares 𝑠𝑘𝑖and 𝑠𝑘𝑗as follows: 𝑘−𝑗 𝑘−𝑖 𝑠𝑘𝑘= 𝑓(𝑘) = 𝑖−𝑗· 𝑠𝑘𝑖+ 𝑗−𝑖· 𝑠𝑘𝑗 (38) where 𝑖, 𝑗, 𝑘∈{1, 2, 3} and 𝑖≠𝑗≠𝑘for a (2, 3) setting. Theoretically, the update protocol can securely update all three shares as long as at least two of them are not tampered with and at most one of them is leaked.

Unforgeability We first claim the unforgeability of our (2, 3)-threshold ECDSA in the following theorem and then prove it. Theorem 1 The (2, 3)-thresholdECDSAinSection4is (𝜏, 𝑞𝑠, 𝑞𝑐, 𝜖)-secureinthe (2, 3)-TEU-CMAmodel, given that the standard ECDSA signature scheme is EU-CMA secure. Specifically, the advantage of any PPT adversary A winning the (2, 3)-TEU-CMA experiment is 𝐴𝑑𝑣(2,3)−𝑇𝐸𝑈−𝐶𝑀𝐴(2,3)−𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑙𝑑𝐸𝐶𝐷𝑆𝐴(A) ≤𝐴𝑑𝑣𝐸𝑈−𝐶𝑀𝐴𝐸𝐶𝐷𝑆𝐴 (B) where 𝐴𝑑𝑣𝐸𝑈−𝐶𝑀𝐴𝐸𝐶𝐷𝑆𝐴 (B) is the advantage of B winning the EU-CMA game. Let A be an adversary against the (2, 3)-threshold ECDSA, and B be the challenger running the (2, 3)-TEU- CMA experiments with A. Meanwhile, B, as an adversary, runs the EU-CMA experiment with an ECDSA challenger C. Therefore, B works as a connector between the (2, 3)-TEU-CMA experiment and the EU-CMA experiment. Below we illustrate how to embed the EU-CMA experiment into the (2, 3)-TEU-CMA experi- ment and reduce the (2, 3)-TEU-CMA security of the (2, 3)-threshold ECDSA to the EU-CMA security of ECDSA. In the (2, 3)-TEU-CMA experiment, B initializes system public parameters and keys and interacts with A. Meanwhile, in the EU-CMA experiment, B interacts with C who initializes the system parameters and keys of ECDSA. Specifically, • Initialization. – Initialization of ECDSA. C initializes the system public parameters pp = {𝐺, 𝑃, 𝑞, 𝑍𝑞} and a pair of public and private keys (𝑝𝑘, 𝑠𝑘) of ECDSA. The system public parameters pp and public key 𝑝𝑘are given to B. – Initialization of (2, 3)-threshold ECDSA. B initializes the three shares of 𝑠𝑘and keys of additively homomorphic encryption scheme as follows: 1. Generate random 𝑠𝑘1, 𝑠𝑘2, 𝑠𝑘3 ∈𝑍𝑞. 2. Generate (ℎ𝑠𝑘, ℎ𝑝𝑘) as specified in the initial splitting protocol. 3. Provide system public parameters and public keys (𝑝𝑘, ℎ𝑝𝑘) to A. • Queries. – Signature queries. A submits a message 𝑚chosen at will to B and queries the signature. B queries C the signature on 𝑚. C runs the Signing algorithm of ECDSA and returns the signature 𝜎to B. Finally, B forwards 𝜎to A. – Corruption queries. A submits an index 𝑖∈{1, 2, 3} to B to make a corruption query. B replies with (𝑠𝑘1, ℎ𝑠𝑘) if 𝑖= 1 and 𝑠𝑘𝑖otherwise. B also replies 𝑠𝑖to A if 𝑖≠3. • Forgery. A returns a forged signature 𝜎∗on some new message 𝑚∗that has never been queried in the query phase. B returns 𝑚∗and 𝜎∗to C. After 𝑞𝑠signature queries and 𝑞𝑐corruption queries, if A wins the (2, 3)-TEU-CMA experiment, then 𝜎∗is a valid signature on 𝑚∗and B wins the TEU-CMA security experiment. Therefore, the advantage of A winning the (2, 3)-TEU-CMA experiment no more than the advantage of B winning the EU-CMA experiment, that is, 𝐴𝑑𝑣(2,3)−𝑇𝐸𝑈−𝐶𝑀𝐴(2,3)−𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑙𝑑𝐸𝐶𝐷𝑆𝐴(A) ≤𝐴𝑑𝑣𝐸𝑈−𝐶𝑀𝐴𝐸𝐶𝐷𝑆𝐴 (B). Since ECDSA is EU-CMA secure, 𝐴𝑑𝑣𝐸𝑈−𝐶𝑀𝐴𝐸𝐶𝐷𝑆𝐴 (B) is negligible. Therefore, 𝐴𝑑𝑣(2,3)−𝑇𝐸𝑈−𝐶𝑀𝐴(2,3)−𝑡ℎ𝑟𝑒𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑙𝑑𝐸𝐶𝐷𝑆𝐴(A) is neg- ligible.

Discussion The initial splitting protocol in Section 4.1 generates dedicated private and public keys for the additively homo- morphic encryption, rather than reusing (𝑠𝑘1, 𝑝𝑘1). Now we explain why reusing (𝑠𝑘1, 𝑝𝑘1) can negatively influence the security of the scheme. If (𝑠𝑘1, 𝑝𝑘1) is used for the additively homomorphic encryption scheme, then the adversary A will be given 𝑝𝑘1 in addition to 𝑝𝑘in the (2, 3)-TEU-CMA security experiment. With 𝑝𝑘1 and 𝑝𝑘, A can derive the other two public keys 𝑝𝑘2 = 𝑠𝑘2 · 𝑃and 𝑝𝑘3 = 𝑠𝑘3 · 𝑃as follows: 1 𝑝𝑘𝑗= · (𝑝𝑘−𝜆1 · 𝑝𝑘1), for 𝑗= 2, 3 (44) 𝜆𝑗 as 1 𝑠𝑘𝑗= · (𝑠𝑘−𝜆1 · 𝑠𝑘1) mod 𝑞, for 𝑗= 2, 3 (45) 𝜆𝑗 Note that B does not have 𝑠𝑘and the discrete logarithms of 𝑝𝑘2 and 𝑝𝑘3. By submitting an index 2 or 3 in the corruption query, A can distinguish the experiment from a real execution of the (2, 3)-threshold ECDSA, which will result in failure of the (2, 3)-TEU-CMA security experiment. 6. EVALUATION We first evaluate the communication cost of the (2, 3)-threshold ECDSA as it is the major concern when deploying the scheme for DApps. Then we estimate the computing cost to provide a reference for real-world deployment. 6.1. Communication cost Thecommunicationcostisestimatedbythenumberofmessagestransmittedamongsecureandpublicpeer-to- peer channels and broadcasting channels in each protocol. Let spc denote secure peer-to-peer channel, ppc denote public peer-to-peer channel, and bc denote broadcasting channel. The estimated communication cost is listed in Table 2. The initial splitting protocol involves two messages over secure channels from the end node to the edge and the cloud and one broadcasting channel to publish the homomorphic encryption key. Notably, the two-party signing protocol uses merely two messages in an offline phase and one message in the online phase, and all are over public channels among the end and edge nodes in the local area. This brings very light communication costs for the application scenario. The update protocol involves two messages for an optional share recovery phase and six for the share renewable phase, and all of them are over public peer-to-peer channels.

The results indicate that this scheme significantly reduces communication complexity. 6.2. Computing cost The computing cost is evaluated via the number of exponentiation (i.e., scalar multiplication over elliptic curve group 𝐺), and the key generation, encryption and decryption algorithms of additively homomorphic encryp- tion scheme. The additively homomorphic encryption scheme is instantiated as the elliptic curve ElGamal encryption “in-the-exponent”. The estimated computing cost is summarized in Table 4, where exp denotes exponentiation. In Table 4, the estimated computing cost for most cells is 0. This does not mean the corresponding protocols bring no computing task to the node. There are still some lightweight operations such as integer addition, integer multiplication, random number generation, etc. Their costs are ignored compared to time-consuming operations such as exponentiation, encryption, etc. Notably, in Table 4, most computing costs are from the pre-signing phase. In practice, this phase can be executed offline before the application’s message is generated. Therefore, the scheme will not influence user experience of DApps given that the online signing phase introduces very low computing costs. To further estimate the computing cost for real-world applications, we test the running time of exponentiation in common end and edge devices (a smartphone and a laptop). Details of the hardware and software environ- ment are explained in Table 5. The average time for computing one exponentiation is 0.0273 seconds on the smartphone and 0.0116 seconds on the laptop. Based on the results, we evaluate the running time for initial splitting as 0.0273 seconds on the end node, and for pre-signing as 0.2998 seconds on the end node and 0.1280 seconds on the edge node. The results are acceptable for real-world applications.", "metadata": {"source_file": "f_oaes_cc_jsss5030_down.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/f_oaes_cc_jsss5030_down.pdf", "page_number": 17, "chunk_id": "f_oaes_cc_jsss5030_down_p17_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241214131719+08'00'"}}

APPLICATION The CEE key management demonstrates the integration of (2, 3)-threshold signature and the CEE comput- ing paradigm. It has wide application prospects for the DApp market and beyond. Below we illustrate the application of CEE key management in a promising blockchain-empowered sector, DePIN. 7.1. Background and key management challenges of DePIN DePIN refers to decentralized physical infrastructure networks utilizing blockchain technology to return the ownership and commercial rights of data back to the users, allowing everyone to benefit from their own digital footprint. As a promising sector, DePIN has been attracting growing interest and investment recently. The leading credit ratings agency, Moody’s Ratings, has highlighted the potential of DePIN to transform physical infrastructure networks[24]. Individuals holding physical devices (e.g., mobile phones, personal computers, smart cars, etc.) can participate in DePIN and get cryptocurrency rewards by providing data or services via their devices, such as providing real-time noise pollution information through a smartphone, supporting nav- igation services by uploading real-time traffic information through an intelligent vehicle while driving, etc. In these cases, the ownership of data is enforced by signatures issued by the private key of the device. The rewards are paid to an address derived from the corresponding public key. Considering the scenario of real-time noise pollution monitoring for a residential community through DePIN. To monitor noise pollution in the community, the related department can collect noise data via DePIN instead of deploying physical equipment itself. An individual user can participate in the DePIN network by installing some DApps for noise pollution monitoring and registering the public key to DePIN. Then, he or she can use the sound recorder of his or her smartphone to collect noise data and submit them to the data requester (e.g., server of the noise pollution monitoring DApps). The noise data are signed by the private key of the user or the smartphone, so that a reward can be paid to the cryptocurrency address derived from the corresponding public key. However, managing the private keys of physical devices is challenging for common users in DePIN. Existing solutions store and use the private key in the physical device. If the physical device is lost, broken, or attacked, the private key will be leaked or unavailable anymore, leading to two serious consequences: • the reward under the cryptocurrency address will be lost, and • a new pair of private and public keys need to be generated, and the user has to register the new public key to DePIN. 7.2. Application of CEE key management in DePIN Now we show how to use the proposed CEE key management to address the key management problem for DePIN users. As shown in Figure 5, the CEE key management service can be provided by a professional security company, a smartphonemanufacturer,etc. Tousethisservice,theDePINusersinstallclientsoftwareontheirsmartphones. By running the software of the CEE key management system in the smartphone, the private key is distributed into three shares kept in the smartphone, the router in the home, and the cloud server of the service provider. When uploading noise pollution data, the smartphone and router run the two-party signing protocol to issue a signature and attach it to the data. The key management cloud is only involved in the key distribution and update phase. With the CEE key management service, when the physical device (e.g., the smartphone) is lost, broken, or attacked, the private key share stored in it is leaked or unavailable anymore. However, the private key remains secure and available as long as the other two shares in the router and cloud server are secure; therefore, the", "metadata": {"source_file": "f_oaes_cc_jsss5030_down.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/f_oaes_cc_jsss5030_down.pdf", "page_number": 18, "chunk_id": "f_oaes_cc_jsss5030_down_p18_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241214131719+08'00'"}}

Further, by running the update protocol, the three shares are refreshed while the public key remains unchanged, which means the second consequence will not occur. 8. CONCLUSION The CEE paradigm has been widely adopted in many online computing products and services, such as smart homes, intelligent transportation, e-health, etc. Combining (2, 3)-threshold key management with CEE pro- vides a very convenient way for implementing key management for online products and services, where the end and edge nodes near the end users are responsible for daily uses of the private key, and the cloud serves in updating the storage of private key shares. The CEE key management framework is anticipated to have wide application in various digital signature and public-key encryption schemes. The proposed (2, 3)-threshold ECDSA demonstrates the application of the CEE key management framework in the widely used ECDSA sig- nature.
