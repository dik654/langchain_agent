{"text": "7 November 2024 Market Update Q3 2024 Crypto Market Update In the third quarter, the crypto market largely moved sideways. Bitcoin's price rose by 5.7%, from around $62,000 to $65,600, fluctuating between $54,000 and $68,000 over the past three months. In contrast, Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, saw a 22.6% price drop during Q3, settling around $2,650. Some market participants attribute this decline to the modest launch of the Ethereum ETF, as unlike the Bitcoin ETF, Ether did not experience the anticipated price boost. Potential reasons include declining on-chain activity and persistently high transaction fees on the Ethereum blockchain. BlackRock attributes the subdued interest from institutional investors to a lack of awareness and growing competition from alternative Layer-1 platforms like Toncoin, Tron, and Solana. Nonetheless, Ethereum remains a leader in smart contracts, boasting the highest number of applications and developers, the highest 30-day average revenue from fees, and the most assets locked in smart contracts. Despite lower-than- expected inflows into the Ethereum ETF, it quickly surpassed the $1 billion mark in assets under management—a milestone that typically takes years for most ETFs to reach, according to BlackRock. In Q3 2024, four key events stand out as having influenced recent market dynamics and are likely to shape the future. First, the former giant exchange Mt. Gox, which ceased operations in 2014, began its initial partial repayments to affected customers. This led to heightened volatility in July, with noticeable price drops. Overall, about 142,000 Bitcoin are expected to be repaid to affected customers by October 2025. The interest rate hike in Japan, announced on July 31, 2024, added further volatility to the capital markets and significantly weakened the yen carry trade. As a result, certain traditional market indices and Bitcoin’s price temporarily dropped by up to 20%. Nevertheless, prices largely recovered in the days that followed. Tether Holdings, the company behind the stablecoin Tether (USDT), reported an impressive record profit of $5.2 billion in the first half of 2024. By comparison, BlackRock—the world’s largest asset manager—earned $5.5 billion in profit for the entirety of 2023. Tether attributes its success to targeted investments in U.S. Treasury bonds and Bitcoin, achieved with a lean team of fewer than 100 employees. By the end of Q3 2024, Tether’s managed assets reached a remarkable $119 billion.", "metadata": {"source_file": "coinix_capital_Q3-2024-Newsletter-English.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/coinix_capital_Q3-2024-Newsletter-English.pdf", "page_number": 2, "chunk_id": "coinix_capital_Q3-2024-Newsletter-English_p2_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241107102840Z00'00'"}}
{"text": "7 November 2024 Market Update Meanwhile, Ethena announced plans to develop a new stablecoin backed by a highly liquid BlackRock fund, highlighting a trend toward more diversified stablecoin options. A chart illustrates the rapid increase in total global stablecoin issuance, with Tether retaining a dominant lead, followed closely by competitor Circle. Year-over-year, the circulating supply of stablecoins has surged by over 40%, representing more than a $50 billion increase. In September, the Federal Reserve announced its first interest rate cut in four years, reducing rates by 50 basis points. This move spurred price increases, particularly across technology stocks and cryptocurrencies. On the on-chain activity front, several noteworthy developments emerged. In the third quarter, the Layer-2 platform “Base” saw remarkable growth, with monthly active users rising from 7.5 million to 22.4 million (+198%). This surge solidified the Coinbase-developed blockchain’s lead among Layer-2 solutions by user count. Meanwhile, its main competitor, Arbitrum One, experienced a significant decline in users (-65.5%), though it remains the leader in transaction volume. During this same period, Base also boosted its daily transactions to 5.1 million (+59%), further establishing itself as the top platform in this metric.", "metadata": {"source_file": "coinix_capital_Q3-2024-Newsletter-English.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/coinix_capital_Q3-2024-Newsletter-English.pdf", "page_number": 3, "chunk_id": "coinix_capital_Q3-2024-Newsletter-English_p3_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241107102840Z00'00'"}}
{"text": "7 November 2024 Market Update VC Investments in Blockchain and Crypto - Q3 2024 In Q3 2024, venture capital investments in the blockchain and crypto sectors totaled $2.4 billion across over 320 funding rounds. After a strong July ($1 billion) and August ($785 million), investment volumes fell to $607 million in September, marking a 22% decrease from the previous month. This decline reflects investor caution in response to economic and geopolitical uncertainties. Noteworthy investment areas included DeFi and AI. In August, around 25% of total investments were directed toward DeFi projects, while AI-related projects received roughly 15% of the allocated capital. September saw infrastructure and DeFi projects dominate, capturing more than half of the total investments. In the U.S., venture capital investment in the crypto sector showed strong recovery after a slump in November 2023. By July 2024, crypto investments accounted for an impressive 6.1% of all U.S. VC deals, signaling a steady upward trend toward the record highs of 2022, when crypto investments comprised nearly 9% of all U.S. VC transactions. This growth is partly driven by regulatory advancements, such as the launch of the Bitcoin ETF, which have bolstered investor confidence. The crypto industry is now outperforming robust sectors like enterprise software and climate technology, reinforcing the long-term upward trajectory and the ambitious goals of a diverse range of projects.", "metadata": {"source_file": "coinix_capital_Q3-2024-Newsletter-English.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/coinix_capital_Q3-2024-Newsletter-English.pdf", "page_number": 4, "chunk_id": "coinix_capital_Q3-2024-Newsletter-English_p4_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241107102840Z00'00'"}}
{"text": "7 November 2024 Portfolio Development Portfolio Development The overall value of the KGaA's portfolio experienced a significant decline in Q3. Assets under management fell from €11.4 million at the beginning of the quarter to €9.4 million by the end, reflecting a decrease of approximately 17%. This downturn was primarily driven by the price declines in major holdings, including The Graph (GRT) and Ethereum (ETH). On the illiquid investment side, however, one of our projects, NATIX, successfully launched its own token on the market. As of the end of the quarter, the value of this position stands at approximately €330,000, reflecting both an increase in liquid tokens and the equity stakes in the company. We are now closely following the launch of the PEAQ token, in which coinIX invested in 2022 at a valuation of $50 million. PEAQ is set to launch on November 12, 2024, and could significantly boost the portfolio's value. Liquid Crypto Portfolio In Q3 2024, the global cryptocurrency market remained relatively stable. The total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies decreased slightly from $2.43 trillion to $2.41 trillion, a drop of around 0.8%. Short-term fluctuations led to a peak of $2.61 trillion in July, followed by a dip to $1.99 trillion in August. During this period, Bitcoin gained nearly 6%, indicating that altcoins generally underperformed. This trend was particularly evident in our portfolio, especially with the significant position in The Graph (GRT), whose price dropped more than 12% in Q3, contributing to a notable reduction in overall portfolio value. On a positive note, the decentralized lending and borrowing protocol Aave saw a remarkable 71% price increase in Q3, reaching a market capitalization of over $2 billion. Aave has become one of the strongest performers in the DeFi sector and now represents one of the top positions in our portfolio. Overall, the value of the liquid tokens in the coinIX GmbH & Co. KGaA portfolio, including both direct and indirect holdings, declined by approximately €1.5 million. By the end of the quarter, the value of liquid tokens and the shares held in COINVEST SCI1 was approximately €7.5 million.", "metadata": {"source_file": "coinix_capital_Q3-2024-Newsletter-English.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/coinix_capital_Q3-2024-Newsletter-English.pdf", "page_number": 5, "chunk_id": "coinix_capital_Q3-2024-Newsletter-English_p5_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241107102840Z00'00'"}}
{"text": "7 November 2024 Stock Development Stock Price Performance The stock began the third quarter at €1.77 and saw a strong initial increase in the first two weeks. By mid-July, the price had risen to around €2.00 and held steady at that level until the end of August. However, heightened volatility in the cryptocurrency market led to fluctuations in the coinIX stock price, with swings between €1.70 and €2.00. Ultimately, the stock was unable to maintain the higher levels and closed the third quarter at approximately €1.60. This overall trend mirrored the movements observed in the broader crypto market.

From July to mid-August, the value dropped sharply from €3.70 to a low of €2.70. However, part of this decline was recovered in September, with the NAV rebounding to €3.00 by the end of the month.

Through Fjord Foundry, the platform brings together groundbreaking projects and committed supporters on a community-driven platform, offering fair and transparent token sales. Fjord focuses on ensuring equitable distribution in token sales, minimizing the impact of bots and whale manipulation. It strives to level the playing field, making sure that disruptive projects and innovative tokens are accessible to all investors, not just a privileged few. The Fjord Foundry Token (FJO) stands out as a promising investment opportunity for several reasons. As one of the largest crypto launchpads, the platform has already facilitated funding rounds totaling over 1 billion EUR, with capital raised from more than 100,000 users. Fjord’s multi-chain support (ETH, ARB, AVAX, OP, BNB, POL) gives users access to a wide range of projects across various networks. The platform’s tokenomics create a deflationary effect, as 90% of profits are used to buy back FJO tokens. So far, Fjord has generated 30 million EUR in fees, with 3 million tokens (3% of the total supply) already removed from circulation. Currently, the token is traded with a daily volume of around 1 million EUR, offering considerable growth potential—especially as it has yet to be listed on major centralized exchanges.
