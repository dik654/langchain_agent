Decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) is cur- rently one of the hottest narratives in Web3. In this report, we present a new thesis of DePIN, namely the modular DePIN infrastructure. By ret- rospecting the evolution of software development platforms for building physical infrastructure networks, we describe the new technology trend of building DePIN applications on top of a community-owned modular DePIN infrastructure and highlight the characteristics of this new DePIN thesis from both technical and economic perspectives. Keywords: DePIN · Infrastructure · Modularity · Community-Driven · Platform Economy 1 Introduction As one of the hottest narratives in Web3, decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) [1] has received a lot of attention recently. DePIN leverages blockchain, Internet of Things (IoT) and tokenomics to incentivize communi- ties to build real-world physical infrastructure networks and machine economy from the bottom up across a wide range of categories, such as mobility, energy, logistics, mapping, telecommunication, and more. DePIN can be classified into two categories [2], namely physical resource networks (PRNs) and digital re- source networks (DRNs). While PRNs focus on providing non-fungible goods and services such as wireless connectivity, mobility and energy, DRNs mainly offer fungible digital resources such as compute, storage and bandwidth. When compared to traditional physical infrastructure network constructions, DePINs can be built in a more efficient and cost-effective manner [3]. While the number of DePIN startups have increased steadily since the past year, the newcomers are facing multiple challenges. Due to the lack of funds and technical competence, it usually takes long time for a DePIN startup to bring its idea to market. In particular, majority of DePIN projects in the market today are still largely centralized, which contradicts with the ultimate vision of DePIN. To address these challenges, we present the modular DePIN infrastructure, a new thesis for DePIN, in this report. The modular DePIN infrastructure can not only help DePIN startups to address their technical challenges and accelerate their go-to-market strategy, but also bring new platform economy and encourage collaboration of the DePIN community towards the common goal of building a community-owned DePIN infrastructure.", "metadata": {"source_file": "cdn_iotex_io_DePIN_Report_v1_Final.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/cdn_iotex_io_DePIN_Report_v1_Final.pdf", "page_number": 2, "chunk_id": "cdn_iotex_io_DePIN_Report_v1_Final_p2_c1", "creationDate": "D:20240605010242Z00'00'"}}

An example of centralized physical infrastructure network is illustrated in Fig. 1. Fig. 1. An example of centralized physical infrastructure network [4]. The physical infrastructure network is deployed and managed by a corporate data center and the AWS infrastructure is used to realize analytics and monitoring applications.

Many physical infrastructure networks deployed today are based on a hybrid archi- tecture, as illustrated in Fig. 2. Fig. 2. An example of hybrid physical infrastructure network. The physical infrastruc- ture network is deployed by community members via token incentives and the AWS infrastructure is used to manage physical resources and realize analytics and monitor- ing applications. In such a hybrid architecture, community members are rewarded by crypto tokens via a smart contract on blockchain to deploy physical infrastructure net- works in a decentralized manner. Meanwhile, the physical infrastructure net- works are still orchestrated by centralized cloud platforms. Note that community members are able to capture certain amount of value along the value chain. 2.3 Physical Infrastructure Networks - The Future Since Messari coined the term \"DePIN\" in the seminal report, Web3 com- munities have been making the effort towards realizing the ultimate vision of community-driven and community-owned physical infrastructure networks, as shown in Fig. 3.

There are four major categories of stake- holders: – Device Manufacturers: The device manufacturers are responsible for man- ufacturing various DePIN devices. – Miners: The miners are incentivized to deploy DePIN devices (physical or virtual) and rewarded by crypto tokens. – Builders: The builders have two sub-categories: • Infrastructure Builders: The infrastructure builders develop core com- ponents and services that can be used by application builders to create DePIN application. • Application Builders: The application builders develop DePIN appli- cations using various components built by the infrastructure builders. – Users: The users use the utilities provided by DePIN applications and pay for their actual usage.", "metadata": {"source_file": "cdn_iotex_io_DePIN_Report_v1_Final.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/cdn_iotex_io_DePIN_Report_v1_Final.pdf", "page_number": 5, "chunk_id": "cdn_iotex_io_DePIN_Report_v1_Final_p5_c1", "creationDate": "D:20240605010242Z00'00'"}}
{"text": "DePIN - A Modular Infrastructure Thesis 5 Fig. 4. A high-level architecture of emerging DePIN infrastructure and applications. 3.1 The Modular DePIN Infrastructure Overview A typical DePIN application could be built out of nine modules, namely hard- ware abstraction, connectivity, sequencer, data availability, long-term storage, off-chain computing, blockchain, identity, and governance. Depending on the re- quirements of a DePIN project, all or a subset of those modules could be utilized. Moreover, some modules may be combined in specific implementations. Fig. 5. An overview of the modular DePIN infrastructure Hardware Abstraction Module: The Hardware Abstraction module features a lightweight embedded SDK that facilitates a wide range of smart devices (big or small) to securely connect with entities in the Connectivity module.

Connectivity Module: The Connectivity module might be a centralized ser- vice or decentralized network that reliably passes data collected from smart de- vices to the sequencer module. The Connectivity module should support one or multiple communication protocols (e.g., HTTP(s), MQTT, WebSockets, Blue- tooth, LoRa, etc.) and enable secure two-way communications between smart devices and the sequencer. Moreover, the connectivity module should scale au- tomatically with the number of connected devices. Sequencer Module: The Sequencer module might be a centralized service or decentralized network that authenticates and sorts data packets received from smart devices before storing them to the Data Availability module. The Se- quencer may also retrieve data in batch from the Data Availability module and send it to another module (e.g., the off-chain computing module) for further processing. Data Availability Module: The Data Availability module might be a central- ized service or decentralized network that stores data temporarily for a project- specified time period. Ingest into the Data Availability module is flexible and can come from either on-chain or off-chain sources. Once this period expires, the stored data might be deleted or moved to the Long-Term Storage module. Based on a project’s configuration, the Data Availability module may also commit data sets to the Blockchain module from time to time. Long-Term Storage Module: The Long-Term Storage module might be a centralized service or decentralized network that is able to store data for long- term retention, depending on the requirements of DePIN projects. The stored data can be retrieved from the Long-Term Storage module for other purposes via storage APIs. While implementation of the Long-Term Storage module varies by network, but it involves uniquely identifying a piece of data (bytes, files, directories, etc.) by some content-addressable, immutable hash representation of the underlying data. The storage timeline can be permanent or time-bound (e.g., many years), and novel sampling mechanisms are employed to ensure the data exists for subsequent retrieval. Off-Chain Computing Module: The Off-Chain Computing module might be a centralized service or decentralized computing resource (e.g., CPU, GPU, FPGA, etc.) pool that is able to perform project-specific business logic on the data stored in the Data Availability module and (optionally) generating validity proofs (e.g., zero-knowledge proofs, TEE-based attestation reports, etc.) of the", "metadata": {"source_file": "cdn_iotex_io_DePIN_Report_v1_Final.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/cdn_iotex_io_DePIN_Report_v1_Final.pdf", "page_number": 7, "chunk_id": "cdn_iotex_io_DePIN_Report_v1_Final_p7_c1", "creationDate": "D:20240605010242Z00'00'"}}

A validity proof, which is essential to ensure integrity of off-chain computations, is then verified on-chain by a corresponding verifier smart contract. Blockchain Module: The Blockchain module serves as the trust anchor of a DePIN application for identity management, device management, data attesta- tion, crypto asset management, etc. The Blockchain module is mainly respon- sible for verifying the validity of off-chain computations and distributing token rewards to DePIN miners. The Blockchain module could also be used for realizing on-chain governance. Identity Module: The Identity module is responsible for managing on-chain and/or off-chain identities (e.g., account abstraction (AA) wallet, decentralized identifiers (DIDs), etc.) for all the entities (e.g., smart devices, users, servers, etc.) in DePIN applications. While an on-chain identity allows users to manage their DePIN assets, an off-chain identity allows machines to securely interact with each other in a decentralized setting. Governance Module: The Governance module, which could be realized on- chain/off-chain or in a hybrid manner, is responsible for defining and enforcing the policies and procedures for each modules in a modular DePIN tech stack. The Governance module allows token holders to make decisions regarding various aspects (e.g., usage of the project treasury, protocol upgrade, etc.) of a DePIN project, typically through a community voting process. 3.2 Characteristics of the Modular DePIN Infrastructure When compared to centralized platforms used for building conventional physical infrastructure networks, the emerging modular DePIN infrastructure has the following salient characteristics: – Community-Owned Platform: Each infrastructure module (i.e., comput- ing, connectivity, storage, etc.) is built and owned by a developer team. As a result, the entire infrastructure platform is jointly owned by the DePIN community. – Multi-Vendor Marketplace: Each infrastructure module could be pro- vided by multiple developer teams. All the infrastructure modules form a free and dynamic marketplace that allows application developers to choose best modules that can suit their needs. – Module-Specific Economy: For each infrastructure module, the devel- oper team has its own economy model design for aligning benefits of all stakeholders. – Composability: An application developer can choose modules provided by different teams to build end-to-end DePIN applications.", "metadata": {"source_file": "cdn_iotex_io_DePIN_Report_v1_Final.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/cdn_iotex_io_DePIN_Report_v1_Final.pdf", "page_number": 8, "chunk_id": "cdn_iotex_io_DePIN_Report_v1_Final_p8_c1", "creationDate": "D:20240605010242Z00'00'"}}

In this section, we describe the state-of-the-art modular DePIN Infrastructure landscape. An overview of the modular DePIN infrastructure landscape is shown in Fig. 9. Fig. 9.

{"text": "12 IoTeX Research key functionalities to enable smart devices to interact with decentralized net- works. To the best of our knowledge, ioConnect [14] developed by IoTeX is the first universal embedded SDK for connecting a wide range of smart devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Arduino, ESP32, smartphones, etc.) to Web3. The ioConnect SDK realizes key security and identity technologies (e.g., Arm’s PSA Certified Crypto API [15], Decentralized Identifiers [16], Verifiable Credentials [17], DIDComm Messaging [18], etc.) to ensure trustworthy connection between smart devices and Web3 networks. DePHY’s hardware SDK [19] also works on the same direc- tion for certain device. Connectivity Module: A number of DePIN projects aim to build decen- tralized connectivity networks for people and devices. These projects have ex- plored various wireless communication techniques, including Bluetooth (e.g., Nodle [20]), LoRaWAN (e.g., Helium [21] and Drop Wireless [22]), WiFi (e.g., Wicrypt [23], WiFi Map [24], Roam [25], and Wayru [26]), 5G (e.g., Karrier One [27], Helium Mobile [28], and World Mobile Token [29]), and P2P network (e.g., Streamr [30]). These connectivity modules facilitate smart device and peo- ple to connect to Web3 networks in different ways. Sequencer Module: While a number of decentralized or shared sequencer projects (see Espresso [31], Metis [32], Astria [33], and Radius [34], for exam- ples) exist, these sequencer solutions were built in the context of Layer-2 rollup networks. However, it is not difficult to adapt the exiting sequencers to serve DePIN applications. Data Availability Module: Quite a few data availability projects have been built during the past few years. Those solutions might realize data availability by leveraging the existing Layer-1 blockchain (e.g., EIP-4844 [35] and Near [37]), using a separate blockchain (e.g., Celestia [36] and Polygon Avail [39]), building upon decentralized storage (e.g., Textile [97]), or resorting to restaking-based approach (e.g., EigenDA [40]). The existing solutions make different security assumptions and implementation trade-offs. Long-Term Storage Module: Long-term storage solutions (e.g., Filecoin [41], Arweave [42], ScPrime [43], ceramic [44], etc.) have been built since the early days of Web3. Those solutions can serve the long-term storage requirements of DePIN applications well. Off-Chain Computing Module: The off-chain computing can be roughly classified into two categories, namely the general- and special-purpose comput- ing networks. While the general-purpose computing networks (e.g., io.net [45], Destra Network [46], Aethir [47], The Render Network [48], Akash [49], In- ferix [50], Network3 [93], etc.) aim to provide decentralized computing resources", "metadata": {"source_file": "cdn_iotex_io_DePIN_Report_v1_Final.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/cdn_iotex_io_DePIN_Report_v1_Final.pdf", "page_number": 13, "chunk_id": "cdn_iotex_io_DePIN_Report_v1_Final_p13_c1", "creationDate": "D:20240605010242Z00'00'"}}
{"text": "DePIN - A Modular Infrastructure Thesis 13 (e.g., CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, etc.) for various applications, the special-purpose computing networks focus on attesting integrity of a specific computation pro- cess. The special-purpose computing networks can be further divided into two sub- categories, namely ZKP- and TEE-based prover networks. On the one hand, the ZKP prover networks contain zkVM (e.g., Risc0 [51], Succinct [52], ICME [53], Nexus [54], etc.), zkWasm (e.g., Delphinus Lab [55], fluent [56], etc.), hardware- accelerated prover (e.g., Cysic [57], Ingonyama [58], etc.), domain-specific lan- guage (DSL) based prover (e.g., Circom [59], ZoKrates [60], etc.), and zkAggrega- tor (e.g., Aligned [61], Nebra [62]). On the other hand, the TEE prover networks contain multiple projects (e.g., Oasis Network [63], Toki [64], Taiko [65], Au- tomata [66], Secret Network [67], Phala Network [68], etc.) that build upon the Intel SGX technology. In addition, W3bstream [69] developed by IoTeX aims to become a multi-prover aggregator for verifiable off-chain computing. Blockchain Module: The leading blockchains that are widely used for building DePIN applications include Ethereum [70], Solana [71], Polkadot [72], IoTeX [73], Polygon [74], Cosmos [75], Eclipse [76], Peaq [77], and BNB Smart Chain [78]. Identity Module: A number of projects have been built to provide identity for people and devices in Web3 applications, among which ioID developed by IoTeX and DePHY [19] focus on device identity based on self-sovereign identity technol- ogy. Web3 ID by Dock [79] applies the same technique to offer people’s identities. Polygon ID [80], zkPass [81] and Worldcoin [82] leverages zero-knowledge proofs and/or secure multi-party computation to protect users’ privacy. In addition, ENS [83] is an on-chain domain service which can also be utilized as an identity system. Governance Module: Two types of governance systems have been explored in the Web3 community, namely on-chain (see Tally [84], Commonweath [85], tezos [86], etc., for examples) and off-chain (see Snapshot [87], oSnap [88], etc., for examples) governance. Those governance systems could be directly applied to each component in a modular DePIN infrastructure to make various decisions. 6 New Platform Economy In this section, we describe the new platform economy that is enabled by the modular DePIN infrastructure. 6.1 From Single to Diversified Economy The conventional software development infrastructure (e.g., cloud computing platforms) that are used to build physical infrastructure networks has a single fixed economic model, as illustrated in Fig. 10.", "metadata": {"source_file": "cdn_iotex_io_DePIN_Report_v1_Final.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/cdn_iotex_io_DePIN_Report_v1_Final.pdf", "page_number": 14, "chunk_id": "cdn_iotex_io_DePIN_Report_v1_Final_p14_c1", "creationDate": "D:20240605010242Z00'00'"}}
{"text": "14 IoTeX Research Fig. 10. The Single Fixed Economy in Cloud Computing Platforms Since all the modules and components are primarily built by cloud service providers, it is up to them to determine the pricing models. Such a fixed eco- nomic model cannot effectively incentivize community developer teams to make contributions. The modular DePIN infrastructure is dedicatedly designed to address the aforementioned issue. As shown in Fig. 11, the entire DePIN infrastructure is owned by the community and each module of which could be built by multiple community developer teams. Fig. 11. The Diversified Economy in the Modular DePIN Infrastructure A salient feature of the modular DePIN infrastructure is the module-specific economy that allows each developer team to design its own economic model for incentivizing its community members and customers in the most effective way. The module-specific economy provides strong incentives and great flexibility for developer teams growing their own communities and working together to achieve the common goal of serving DePIN application developers simultaneously. 6.2 The Modular DePIN Infrastructure Flywheel Once the cold start has been achieved, DePIN projects should enter a dynamic equilibrium that is often referred to as the flywheel effect.

{"text": "18 IoTeX Research It is clear to see that a majority of venture capital funds go to the projects that build the connectivity, data availability, long-term storage, and off-chain computing modules in the modular DePIN infrastructure currently. Such an in- vestment landscape is expected to continuously evolve with new DePIN projects breaking into the market. Considering the explosive growth of DePIN projects recently, the modular DePIN infrastructure has great investment potential as the fundamental basis of building emerging DePIN applications. 8 Outlook With the increasing number of Web3 startups joining the DePIN revolution and the amount of investments in the DePIN thesis, the DePIN sector is going to be- come more mature in 2024 with respect to technology stack and tools, ecosystem and community growth, as well as real-world adoption. The proposed modular DePIN infrastructure thesis aims to address the key technical challenges faced by many DePIN builders. We expect that the DePIN community can work together closely to realize the first community-owned modular DePIN infrastructure that can be used by a wide range of existing and emerging DePIN projects. Appendix The modular DePIN infrastructure is the foundation to empowering existing and emerging DePIN applications. The following DePIN projects (in alphabetical order) are either developing infrastructure modules or exploring an instantiation of the modular DePIN infrastructure for empowering their applications. Aethir [47] has built distributed GPU-based compute infrastructure for enter- prise use cases. Aethir makes it easier for GPU infrastructure providers to scale, and simpler for buyer to access GPU worldwide. ATOR [89] is building the largest global anonymous-routing ecosystem, lever- aging a decentralized privacy protocol, on-chain incentives and signature hard- ware to rapidly scale the network. DATS [90] DATS boosts Web3 security by conducting cybersecurity audits using hacker-inspired tactics and Distributed High Power Computing (D-HPC) to defend against complex cyber threats. DIMO [5] is an open and user-controlled IoT protocol and network.
