{"text": "2023 IN REVIEW The digital asset landscape experienced significant turbulence over the past couple of years, with the price of Bitcoin hitting an 18-month low of approximately $16,500 as of January 2023. This low followed a string of negative events, including the insolvency of several crypto protocols, exchanges, lenders, and asset managers such as Terra UST stablecoin, FTX exchange, and Three Arrows Capital in 2022. However, towards the end of 2023, digital asset prices began rising, with Bitcoin returning more than 150% overall in 2023. Several contributing factors may explain the asset class’ resurgence, including the possibility of the U.S. Federal Reserve reversing its stance on interest rate hikes, BlackRock’s entrance into the spot Bitcoin ETF race, and a few regulatory wins for the industry such as Ripple Labs and Grayscale winning court cases against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

{"text": "Regulatory Landscape Changes In 2023, the global regulatory landscape for digital assets underwent diverse developments, reflecting the varying stances of different nations. The European Union introduced the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework, a comprehensive regulatory system focusing on crypto-asset markets and targeting stablecoins. On the other side of the globe, the United States grappled with regulatory clarity, struggling to define jurisdictional responsibilities between agencies like the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Similar regulatory developments can also be observed in Asia. Countries like Singapore, Japan, and Hong Kong have started establishing crypto rules. In Japan, a detailed regulatory framework involving collaboration between the Financial Services Agency (FSA), Japan Virtual and Crypto Assets Exchange Association (JVCEA), and Japan Security Token Offering Association (JSTOA) established measures like the Payment Services Act and stringent anti-money laundering practices. In Singapore, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) acts as a regulator that oversees institutions in banking, capital markets, insurance, and payments. In August 2023, the MAS finalized its stablecoin regulatory framework, aiming to oversee single-currency stablecoins (SCS) pegged to the Singapore Dollar or any G10 currency that are issued in Singapore. In Hong Kong, the regulatory landscape is actively evolving under the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) guidance. The HKMA issued a discussion paper on crypto-assets and stablecoins and published its conclusion of the discussion, marking a significant milestone in Hong Kong's journey to establish a comprehensive and adaptive regulatory environment for the digital asset market.

{"text": "2024 CRYPTO DATA TRENDS Entering 2024, some key events and trends that are likely to shape the digital asset industry and its data needs are outlined below. Trend #1: Bitcoin’s Halving Bitcoin’s halving is an event that happens approximately every four years and is integral to its mining algorithm. This process, built to balance inflation and uphold scarcity, involves a 50% reduction in mining rewards. Halving events have occurred in November 2012, July 2016, and May 2020, with the fourth slated for April 2024. When the next halving occurs, miner rewards will decrease from 6.25 to 3.125 bitcoins. To maintain the Bitcoin blockchain, a decentralized network of miners verifies transactions through a process known as mining. Bitcoin miners are rewarded with newly minted BTC to incentivize their work. The reward, initially set at 50 BTC per block when Bitcoin was introduced in 2009, undergoes halving approximately every 210,000 blocks, shaping the overall supply. This systematic reduction is designed to infuse scarcity and impact Bitcoin's supply. Bitcoin's unique deflationary supply schedule distinguishes it from other digital assets. The maximum supply is capped at 21 million BTC. Historically, Bitcoin’s halving has significantly influenced the asset’s price dynamics, contributing to its reputation as a store of value. The schedule of halving events is set to continue until the year 2140, when the block reward is estimated to reach zero, and the total supply of bitcoins will reach 21 million. Analyzing historical data reveals a compelling correlation between Bitcoin's price and halving events. Following the three previous halvings, Bitcoin's value experienced significant upward trends. However, it is crucial to note that while the halving is a prominent factor, various external elements, such as monetary policies and market conditions, also contribute to Bitcoin's price movements. 14 Copyright© 2024 – DIGITAL ASSET RESEARCH", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_digitalassetresearch_com_DAR-Digital-Asset-Data_-2023-Recap-and-2024-Trends.docx.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_digitalassetresearch_com_DAR-Digital-Asset-Data_-2023-Recap-and-2024-Trends.docx.pdf", "page_number": 15, "chunk_id": "www_digitalassetresearch_com_DAR-Digital-Asset-Data_-2023-Recap-and-2024-Trends.docx_p15_c1", "title": "DAR - Digital Asset Data: 2023 Recap and 2024 Trends.docx"}}

{"text": "Trend #2: Digital Asset Indexes Construction Boom Continues The digital assets index landscape is seeing a substantial increase in new products, which highlights a recognition of the appetite for index-based strategies within the ecosystem. As the industry matures, institutional investors are increasingly drawn to the structured and diversified exposure that indexes offer. Additionally, the complexity and diversity of financial mechanisms in the digital asset ecosystem, such as staking to generate yield and the rise of specific sectors (layer 2 protocols, GameFi, smart contracts), justify the need for indexes that capture a specific portion of the market. As an example, in October 2023, Grayscale Investments partnered with FTSE Russell, the index division of the London Stock Exchange's parent company, to introduce five new indexes that track digital asset sectors: Currencies; Smart Contract Platforms; Financials; Consumer and Culture; and Currencies Utilities and Services. This collaboration signifies a shift from the traditional focus on major crypto assets toward a more nuanced understanding of the evolving crypto landscape.

{"text": "Trend #3: A More Organized Cryptoverse The digital asset market is becoming increasingly complex with every new emerging sector. A market that used to be dominated by Bitcoin and Ethereum has evolved into numerous verticals such as Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN), bridging protocols, liquid staking, layer 2 protocols, and many more. To better capture the nuance of the digital assets market, a proper classification methodology to map digital assets into different sectors is needed. For instance, the Digital Asset Taxonomy System (DATS) is a comprehensive framework that classifies over 1,700 digital assets based on their functionality or use case, including overarching themes and subthemes. The chart below shows an example of a comparison of returns across DATS sectors in 2023.

{"text": "Trend #4: Real-World Asset Tokenization Continues Real-World Assets (RWAs) are becoming an area of focus among institutional players and seeing an increase in total value locked within decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. The tokenization of real-world assets involves the conversion of tangible and intangible assets, such as real estate, cars, collectibles, fine art, gold, and other items with inherent value, into digital assets that can be traded on a blockchain. Over the past year, RWA tokenization providers have witnessed a surge in interest from firms from both inside and outside of the digital asset industry. Notably, the Avalanche Foundation invested $50 million to facilitate the integration of more tokenized RWAs. Traditional finance institutions including JP Morgan and Standard Chartered have also ventured into the space with their own asset tokenization programs. Furthermore, the Monetary Authority of Singapore launched a tokenization pilot program in November 2023. U.S. Treasuries are the most notable asset that has been tokenized. As of December 2023, more than $780M of U.S. Treasuries has been tokenized by 12 providers, which was a significant increase over January 2023 which saw only ~$100M tokenized by 3 providers. Source: Digital Asset Research After the RWA tokenization landscape matured throughout 2023, the stage is set for increased provider diversity in 2024, with protocols offering investors access to tokenizing a broader spectrum of assets across different blockchains. 19 Copyright© 2024 – DIGITAL ASSET RESEARCH", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_digitalassetresearch_com_DAR-Digital-Asset-Data_-2023-Recap-and-2024-Trends.docx.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_digitalassetresearch_com_DAR-Digital-Asset-Data_-2023-Recap-and-2024-Trends.docx.pdf", "page_number": 20, "chunk_id": "www_digitalassetresearch_com_DAR-Digital-Asset-Data_-2023-Recap-and-2024-Trends.docx_p20_c1", "title": "DAR - Digital Asset Data: 2023 Recap and 2024 Trends.docx"}}

{"text": "Trend #6: Increasing Interest in Digital Asset ESG Research As the digital assets industry continues to grow, conversations around the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) implications of these assets are starting to gain more attention. Although ESG is well understood for traditional assets, the sustainability of digital assets is a relatively unexplored topic. Digital assets that are built on top of blockchain technology could be subject to ESG concerns such as: ● High energy consumption to facilitate blockchain transactions and mining. ● Illicit use of the technology due to limited regulation. ● A lack of transparency, especially among newer crypto projects. Because of their unique nature, digital assets require a different assessment of ESG risks than traditional assets. FTSE Russell, an index provider, acknowledged in a recent interview that both ESG and the emerging digital asset space “require new degrees of risk assessment and rigor to create an appropriate index.” Environmental Social Governance Traditional Includes how a company Includes how a company Includes a company’s Finance protects or interacts with interacts with employees, leadership, incentives, the environment and suppliers, customers, and internal controls, audits, related policies other stakeholders and shareholder rights Crypto Assets Includes the project’s Includes the strength and Includes the quality and environmental impact other aspects of the durability of the token’s project’s communities governance Source: Digital Asset Research In 2024, ESG is expected to play a role as the industry continues to mature and investors look for assets aligned with their standards.

{"text": "Trend #7: Faster Data Delivery The importance of faster data delivery is paramount for the digital assets market due to its global, permissionless, and 24/7 nature. At any given moment, market participants can conduct transactions from anywhere in the world, which emphasizes the need for access to real-time data to make timely and informed decisions. Moreover, the digital assets market fluctuates rapidly and is known for its volatility. Whether an investor is looking to capitalize on market opportunities or seeking to manage risk, faster data ensures that participants can better adapt to market conditions. Additionally, the nature of blockchain as a railway for permissionless value and data transfer means that there is an abundance of data that can be accessed by any participant. As digital asset markets continue to become more sophisticated in 2024, real-time price data will become even more important for some use cases because of its ability to capture price changes and volatility, as shown in the chart below which compares 15-second pricing to 400-millisecond pricing across a series of assets.

{"text": "CONCLUSION The digital assets market took significant steps forward in 2023 as it saw an increase in market capitalization, numerous spot Bitcoin ETF filings in the U.S., an increase in regulatory clarity across different jurisdictions, and signals that institutions are planning to enter the space. In 2024, the digital asset industry is likely to continue to advance behind events like Bitcoin’s halving and the possibility of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval in the U.S. The continued evolution of the industry could also lead to trends like an increase in digital asset indexes, additional interest in digital asset taxonomy systems, more RWA tokenization, a focus on ESG for crypto assets, and a need for faster digital asset data. 24 Copyright© 2024 – DIGITAL ASSET RESEARCH", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_digitalassetresearch_com_DAR-Digital-Asset-Data_-2023-Recap-and-2024-Trends.docx.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_digitalassetresearch_com_DAR-Digital-Asset-Data_-2023-Recap-and-2024-Trends.docx.pdf", "page_number": 25, "chunk_id": "www_digitalassetresearch_com_DAR-Digital-Asset-Data_-2023-Recap-and-2024-Trends.docx_p25_c1", "title": "DAR - Digital Asset Data: 2023 Recap and 2024 Trends.docx"}}
