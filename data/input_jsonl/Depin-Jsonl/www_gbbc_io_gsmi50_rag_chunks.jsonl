{"text": "In the fast-changing environment in which blockchain technology and digital assets are developing, new themes and new key stakeholders arise with each launch of GSMI, as the GBBC community remains relevant on the importance of fundamental principles and standards for harmonized global scale for these solutions. For the regulatory map, the team expanded the content and made it more user-friendly, covering over 3,400 individual regulatory developments across 230 jurisdictions & 6 international regulatory bodies, while introducing enhanced filtering features. GSMI 5.0 also expanded the taxonomy to include 391 terms, including multiple definitions for blockchain and digital assets terms, from globally recognized standards setters, that users can also filter over an interactive format. This is meant to document the landscape of definitions as they exist today, mindful that these definitions will evolve with further development of the space. These definitions include the work of GBBC as co-chair of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Global Markets Advisory Committee (GMAC) – Digital Asset Markets Subcommittee (DAMS), which presented a Digital Assets Classification Approach and Taxonomy that was approved on March 6, 2024. In addition to updating the relevant definitions, the GSMI 5.0 also added a set of visuals to portray related definition clusters. The technical standards section continues to become more comprehensive, this time including 67 bodies advancing standards, characterized as globally or regionally-focused standards setters, associations, and regulators setting standards for various aspects of the industry. In addition to the technical standards listing, GSMI now introduced a set of cross-cutting use cases for technical standards that can improve business and organizational competitiveness across all industries and sectors: organizational resilience, use of resources, identity verification, and tokenization. These use cases are presented in the context of the increasing importance of decentralized governance, and key principles where technical standards are fundamental to advance the necessary governance that will enable this new generation of models of business and organizational activity to unlock massive industries in the future. GSMI 5.0 also continues to updates the blockchain and digital assets landscape mapping of over 2,000 stakeholders, categorized across essential functions (e.g., data providers, exchanges, wallets and custodians, decentralized finance applications, supporting infrastructure), while the mapping of courses from accredited educational institutions is also expanded to include 1,500+ courses. Finally, GSMI 5.0 releases 5 in-depth reports as the output of 5 of its working groups, focused on areas where the GBBC community recognizes significant opportunities for blockchain technology developments: Blockchain & AI Convergence, Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Digital Identity, Supply Chain, and Sustainability. While the DeFi report provides foundational topics on the space, with the launch of the new DeFi working group with GSMI 5.0, the other reports build on the previous year’s foundational reports, focusing this year on tangible use cases and principles for standards and regulations. In addition, in collaboration with key stakeholders, GSMI produced a Country Spotlight on India, covering the latest developments in blockchain and digital assets in the country. India sets an example of startup activity and government openness to supporting blockchain technology implementations to improve lifestyles. With this comprehensive body of resources, we hope it will serve our community and continue to develop in meaningful ways for the years to come. 4", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "page_number": 7, "chunk_id": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50_p7_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241202113952-06'00'"}}

GSMI 5.0 has documented the latest trends toward increasing regulatory clarity, harmonized approaches across jurisdictions, and attempts to develop rules and requirements that will support innovation and inclusion, while ensuring adequate security and consumer and investor protections. Governments bodies continue to take part in relevant discussions, assessments, and collaborative endeavors to share lessons learned and coordinate global approaches to regulation. Regulatory sandboxes are continuing to facilitate testing environments, and many efforts are taking place to clarify rules beyond enforcement actions setting precedent for the legal treatment of blockchain technology. There remain open questions for risk assessments ahead and other key issues, but progress is being made, often through industry bodies and key principles driven by industry players. GSMI 5.0 has documented over 3,400 documents, many of these primary resources, pertaining to regulatory developments for blockchain and digital assets in 230 jurisdictions and 6 international bodies. These include sovereign countries, monetary unions (e.g., European Union and African monetary unions), states (e.g., US states), and major global policymaking bodies (e.g., Financial Action Task Force) that set standards and requirements for countries globally to embed into their respective regulatory frameworks. Regulatory developments span a wide range of issues, with financial surveillance & AML/KYC/CFT, consumer & investor protections, taxation, CBDCs, and financial infrastructure being the most common, aside from comprehensive regulatory frameworks that cover several issues. This trend of the most common themes for regulatory developments continues from GSMI 4.0 and prior.

Technical standards are fundamental for all use cases and sectors in which this technology is being adopted. They establish common guidelines, definitions, and rules of the game through technical criteria, specifications, methodologies, and practices which all serve to ensure adequate functionality as well as the levels of interoperability, trust, and ease of use necessary for stakeholders to work together. Collaboration is fundamental for the growth of an industry, in ways that will ultimately lead to widespread acceptance of formalized rules and regulations. This repository of 67 technical standards bodies is meant to provide an objective overview of the state of standards developments today for blockchain and digital assets, with no vested interests from any particular organization. Technical Standards are fundamental for governance, especially as decentralized governance structures arise enabled by blockchain technology. Below we provide a commentary on standards as they relate to a value chain of governance. In this context, technical standards are also enabling overarching foundational use cases that are key for success across industries and sectors: tokenization, identity verification, business continuity, and resource management. In the content provided, we continued to facilitate ways for readers to identify how they can work with other groups, and for industry standards organizations to identify for gaps, opportunities, and areas for alignment. We also worked to make it easier to compare across standards bodies based on their purpose and proposed outcome, while also allowing for self-identification based on their topics and industries of focus. Standards in the space are marked according to their proposed outcome, which may be technical standards and specifications, regulatory compliance, or best practices and governance. The standards bodies are also categorized by their main function as global or regional standards setters or associations, and whether they may have a regulatory affiliation. 11", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "page_number": 14, "chunk_id": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50_p14_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241202113952-06'00'"}}

{"text": "SECTION VII AI & BLOCKCHAIN CONVERGENCE: USE CASES, FOUNDATION MODELS, AND KEY PRINCIPLES FOR GROWTH EXECUTIVE SUMMARY With the rapid expansion of AI across all industries, interactions between humans and machines are creating endless possibilities, which can make existing solutions better but also make existing problems worse, all while creating new and unanticipated issues. Now more than ever, cooperation among stakeholders is essential to ensure responsible innovation that will benefit humanity. Blockchain can provide a spectrum of verified and trusted data going into AI algorithms, which can then draw patterns to guide informed decision making. AI, on the other hand, can improve blockchain applications. The use of data verified on a blockchain can address many of our concerns over unchecked AI applications, and also provide more legitimacy to AI-driven outcomes. How does this get real today for all of us? Many use cases are already leveraging this convergence, often through foundation models, and driven by global regulatory developments. In the context of emerging technology convergence and the rise of Web3, the sections below highlight when and where the combination of AI and blockchain can bring the most value. This report will bring awareness to strategic use cases at the convergence of blockchain and AI, the role of foundation models, and how companies can take advantage of these opportunities, remaining competitive while also mitigating potential risks. Finally, there is a commentary on essential standards and regulatory developments, including recommendations to fill any gaps. PUTTING THE AI EXPLOSION INTO PERSPECTIVE With the rise of ChatGPT, ChatGPT-4, and a myriad of AI tools to enhance virtually every facet of our human activities, important questions are being raised with respect to the interaction between humans and machines. For instance, if an estimated 44% of legal tasks to be automated,1 where does that leave humans? As company cultures are being adapted to AI, the roles of humans and machines are evolving. Yet machines may struggle to replace human insight, our emotional connections, and our lived experiences. AI is essentially an archipelago of various sciences and technologies that are built on logic, statistics, deduction, and associations. AI divorces agency from intelligence, creating a new form of agency that is automated in nature. This automated agency alone, without human intelligence, can result in 15", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "page_number": 18, "chunk_id": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50_p18_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241202113952-06'00'"}}

When AI solutions can maximize our possibilities to carry out and achieve any task, the point may not be to maximize activity and functionality alone, but to do so in the right way. Attention to responsible AI, from its very design and throughout its developments, can avoid significant monetary and reputational risks, while ensuring sustainable innovation and long-term competitiveness. A taxonomy of key AI terms can be found in Annex 1. Better solutions & worse problems? In expanding human capabilities, AI can improve existing solutions greatly. Yet the downside can be equally large in magnitude by making existing problems worse, and creating new ones along the way. AI is built on data, which can be used to make more informed decisions, but can also be misused for harmful purposes, and no one knows what can happen in the future. The potential dangers and their future repercussions are unknown. For instance, an AI algorithm using data that heavily represents a majority population may conclude that minority populations need less services, when on the contrary they are underserved and underrepresented in the data. This may lead to actions with the opposite effect than what is in fact needed, broadening inequalities rather than solutions. Unintended consequences and malicious activities with data can lead to unprecedented harms that need to be considered.

Provenance of data is essential for a multiplicity of activities, industry sectors, and business practices, from supply chain traceability to ensuring the authenticity of products (e.g., champagne can only be called champagne if comes from the designated area of France). It can provide a stamp of approval that there has been no forfeiture, and that ethical business practices have been adhered to throughout a given process (e.g., no forced labor). Blockchain technology can also validate that the origin of data comes from legitimate sources, increasing the reliability of AI implementations that are built with that data. If an algorithm utilizes data protected by copyright or behind paywalls, data derived from children, or worse yet, from dark markets, actions can be taken to refrain from using that model, and if it’s an entity’s power, to quarantine and destroy the model altogether. Moreover, visibility on the origin of data can also enable better evaluating its adequacy for implementing AI solutions intended to address specific needs. Transparency on data sources helps identify the existence of potential risks from relying on biased or limited information, and take necessary measures to address and mitigate these risks. Not all data may be fit for purpose, and data deserts are important to identify. For instance, data sets that heavily represent a narrow population may not be adequate for AI solutions applied to broader populations, for the risk of spurious connections and irrelevant conclusions. Data Quality: There is a vast amount of data available, of which the majority has been created during this generation. Moreover, not all the data created in this generation has been about ground truths of human lived experience; rather, much is interpreted, 3rd party, synthetic data. The further the distance from ground truths, the greater the issue of potential AI model failure. Potential issues can also result from the fact that older data records (e.g., paper archives, black and white movies, and even ancient papyrus records) are much less pervasive, and not designed for AI. Blockchain can bring light to these concerns and identify potential biases, empowering companies and organizations to redesign processes accordingly. Furthermore, data quality can be regarded as a spectrum, starting with direct from source vs. interpreted data, 3rd party data, synthetic data, and beyond. Models are likely to be most reliable when they minimize the low-quality data used in training. This enables a future where humans become extremely valuable as data providers, given that human lived experiences become the preferred form of data to ensure AI model robustness. Blockchain technology can provide a scoring system that rates the extent to which the data used by an AI algorithm is sourced from direct lived experience (higher quality data) vs. synthetic data (less quality data). 17", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "page_number": 20, "chunk_id": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50_p20_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241202113952-06'00'"}}
{"text": "Data Privacy & Security Currently, it is not the data itself but trade Figure 2: Blockchain-based AI solutions secrets that can be protected by copyright (source: GSMI 4.0 AI Convergence report) laws. If data is disclosed, it is not protected. If confidential data is leaked and misused, the results and implications can be devastating and may be largely unknown. There is uncertainty on where potential integrations can go using leaked data. Especially when data alone is not regulated, the countermeasures may be very limited. This creates a backstop, and an incentive not to disclose data even when data sharing would be beneficial, potentially leading to multiple difficulties for companies and organizations adopting AI solutions. Blockchain technology enables better privacy protection mechanisms to ensure data is safeguarded, allowing personal data to be exchanged as needed and protected simultaneously. Cryptography & zero- knowledge proofs (ZKPs) can be used to verify the necessary data for a given activity without revealing additional and unnecessary information. Pseudonymity may enable compliance with privacy requirements, and data may be made available only to authorized parties. Blockchain-based verifications can also ensure that data is not manipulated. These measures can bring multiple benefits to operational processes, laws and policies. Blockchain capabilities can enhance processes to manage third-party risk and reduce vulnerabilities. Moreover, authentication of data by a blockchain can prevent cyberhacks. As a best practice, sensitive data would not be stored in central repositories or recorded directly on the blockchain. Code would be audited to prevent data theft and other risks, and both risk analysis and KYC reporting can draw on existing practices used in financial services today. Transparency on Processes & Outcomes Beyond the data sources, blockchain adds transparency to methods of processing data with AI algorithms, as well as their final outcomes. With greater visibility on approaches to data processing and decisions resulting from AI uses, the entire lifecycle can be traced and validated. For instance, blockchain can document the properties of tools like Large Language Models (LLMs). Records can be kept for monitoring and evaluating results and effectiveness of AI solutions, and ultimately as a mechanism to enforce established ethical guidelines. 18", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "page_number": 21, "chunk_id": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50_p21_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241202113952-06'00'"}}
{"text": "Transparency can help identify instances where AI suggested solutions may be irrelevant, and even harmful to carry out. For instance, an AI algorithm drawing on data that heavily represents a population other than that of users can be identified for adequate action to be taken. Decision makers can better understand the potential and limitations of AI developments and their resulting outcomes. Based on the insights provided by blockchain records, processes can be reinvented to preserve equality and inclusion, rather than economic and social disparities. Measures can be taken to ensure automation does not cause job losses when certain functions are replaced by machines, but rather optimize the use of human capabilities to ensure adequate AI deployments. Finally, decentralization of data and processes can address concentrations of power, avoiding single points of failure to add resilience to systems. USE CASES OF BLOCKCHAIN & AI The use cases below are a testament to all the innovations where blockchain technology and AI are working together toward better and more reliable solutions, in ways that can affect every aspect of human civilization. Convergence between these technologies is improving solutions at the very infrastructure level, enabling foundational use cases on which a wide range of innovations can be built across sectors. A second category of use cases comprises solutions that build on these foundational use cases, enabling solutions tailored to specific industries and sectors. Many of the use cases in the table below are expected to continue to evolve with new sub-applications. A key feature to highlight among the use cases below comprises decentralized AI, which inherently merges blockchain and AI, in ways that fundamentally transform the way artificial intelligence is developed, governed and used. Decentralization allows AI models to be created in a grassroots manner rather than relying on centralized models, providing an alternative to a scenario where few centralized players would dominate resources and compute capacity. Any participant can create, share, and monetize AI solutions through decentralized AI networks. Allowing decentralized players to build models can help reduce potential concentration of control and power. While blockchain can decentralize the AI stack, AI can learn and run processes based on distributed sources of data and compute. The decentralization of AI systems takes us to a level of transparency that is often lacking and deeply needed in our current centralized systems. Decentralized AI prioritizes transparency, ethical governance, and empowerment of individuals and actors.

{"text": "Ethical Considerations With greater power to effect change comes greater responsibility. Ethical considerations point to the underlying purpose of AI deployments, as intended by a sense of morality and values to ensure the wellbeing of humanity. As any other tool, AI can be used for good or for harm, but in this case the potential impacts in either direction can be exponential. It is important to define basic shared values to ensure AI implementations ultimately support the common good. It is imperative for AI use cases to take these ethical considerations seriously from the very design and intent, and monitor adherence to ethical considerations throughout their lifecycle. Ethics and safety measures must be built into the very model, not tacked onto the end of a process. It is equally important to note, however that ethics is a process more than an end point, especially given the rapid developments in the technology and the novel issues they raise. Participatory ethics can be difficult due to the challenges of equally and fairly representing all diverse views and populations into AI models. While we may not approve of an elected official, for instance, we hopefully can trust in the democratic processes for electing leadership. In a similar way, trust and reliability in the process for ensuing ethical AI are key. Buy-in from senior leadership is essential whenever possible. Companies and organizations must also be cautious and humble about the unknowns that AI can bring, acknowledging the multiplicity of future outcomes that can take place. With the increasing pace of change and acceleration, it is crucial to be fast and nimble in order to adapt to changing circumstances, needs, and potential concerns. There will be a constant back and forth between AI and the world’s complex challenges. There should also be a “hierarchy” in ethical considerations to prioritize key issues in these complex scenarios. Ethics for AI becomes a multifaceted endeavor that can involve multiple tasks and considerations, summarized in the following basic principles: • Equality & Inclusion: Inclusive decision-making processes go hand in hand with ensuring adequate representation of diverse communities and perspectives. It is necessary to consider the social and economic impacts of AI, especially in light of the key societal challenges that this technology may even be intended to address. With the speed of scale and rate of change, the risk of leaving behind entire communities becomes crucial (e.g., faster chips and functions may require bandwidth and Internet connectivity that are not available for entire populations to access). When things go wrong, AI has the potential to harm marginalized communities the most. • Protection of Human Agency: AI solutions should be designed as co-pilots of humans, enhancing rather than replacing our agency. In past de-skilling models, humans needed to understand a task to make it more efficient and teach it to other humans. With AI, humans must understand tasks to teach them to machines. This requires off-skilling and re-skilling in ways that must keep humans at the helm of decision making and supervision, not merely as a step in a larger process. Human insight cannot be fully replaced by machines and must be present throughout the entire process of training data, running algorithms, and interpreting the results. • Privacy, Security & Fairness: While there are different ways of approaching security and privacy, it is necessary to ensure resilient systems and identities. Companies and organizations are being increasingly rated on trust and motivation. Users and customers 24", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "page_number": 27, "chunk_id": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50_p27_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241202113952-06'00'"}}

Ethical AI developments should safeguard individual rights and liberties based on a sense of sovereignty. • Governance & Accountability: Trust is fundamental for AI, alongside a notion of a dynamic social compact that adjusts with new issues at the technology progresses. Trust frameworks should be founded upon governance and interoperability considerations. They should reflect a broad understanding of the collective benefits relative to any risks of AI. Shared values, responsibilities, and roles point to the importance of continued collaboration among stakeholders. While companies may have different priorities for models and governance approach (e.g., depending on the size of the company), it is beneficial to define a roadmap and strategy with specific principles to prioritize. • Managing AI Risks: An adequate approach to risk assessment and mitigation will reduce misuse and unintended consequences. Understanding risk implications, as a starting point from the design of any AI model, can lead to better assessing the full tech stack behind each use case from an ethical perspective. AI agents, for instance, can learn and run models that embed risk considerations alongside the benefits they offer. FOUNDATION MODELS Foundation models are tools that are trained on substantial amounts of data to carry out a wide range of activities, enhancing business intelligence and any of the use cases in the section above with increasing accuracy. Their adoption has exploded in recent years, as have the amount of foundation models available for the public to use, which are now in the hundreds. With larger industry players creating new models consistently, there are also gravitational pulls toward economies of scale. Models may be open to the public on any device, or alternatively they may require login via software and subscriptions for enhanced tasks.

{"text": "While traditional AI models, are more narrow and built from scratch, foundation models can be pre-trained, providing developers with a solid starting point to build applications, which in turn make them more likely to outperform traditional models. They can contribute to the democratization of AI by lowering barriers to entry. Foundation models are versatile and can be fine-tuned in many ways, making them much more flexible and adaptable. They often experience ongoing training, with constant new version releases. By fine-tuning data into narrower datasets to carry out specific tasks, foundation models also make new AI application development faster, more efficient, less expensive, and reliant on less compute power. Recent trends point toward smaller models, with reliable data as sources and results. Specified tasks point to pre-trained data and processes, that may be domain-specific or general in their approach. For instance, an LLM educated on image analysis, healthcare data, translation, etc. can be adapted to specific use cases and applications. Foundation models can also be supplemented with organizational data. Even micro-foundation models can be built as specialized generative AI solutions to for domain-specific tasks, such as sustainability issues. They can decrease costs, capitalize on the opportunities of AI democratization, and preserve sovereignty of data.4 The context in which foundational models operate, and any relevant standardization practices, are also key. Topic domains (e.g., healthcare, finance, insurance) can provide insight to better understand and design models and datasets. Blockchain technology can be useful for applying metrics to these models (e.g., subject focused), or general adaptations for specific sectors (e.g., issues like data ownership, incentives for decentralized AI, etc.). Blockchain can optimize foundation models Blockchain technology can help optimize both existing foundation models and new models that being built. There are implications of the data sets on which the foundation models are trained. It is important to have previously trained data, from legitimate sources. Otherwise, if there are no checks and balances on open models, the data may include information from unwanted sources such as the leaked data or other data on the dark web, children’s data, etc. Blockchain technology can also help reduce biases from pretraining models on concepts like gender, skin color, etc. The evolution of LLMs, for instance, this can have implications on the validity and ease of compromising data. Once models are trained, they cannot be untrained or “forget.” Therefore, tainted models with unwanted data can become a major liability for any companies and organizations using them. This is especially concerning because we don’t fully understand the third-party implications or risks that may come from their use. Even though the intent of foundational models is automation, the quality, coherence, and relevance of the outputs generated by these models need to be assured. Blockchain can enable different parts of the process to be carried out with greater trust. This way, it is the entire process, more than just the outcome, that becomes validated (e.g., guaranteeing a smart contract has executed a process, or that other steps have been followed through). Blockchain can benefit foundation models in the following ways: 28", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "page_number": 31, "chunk_id": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50_p31_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241202113952-06'00'"}}

Inference: Recording how models are utilized to produce outputs 5. Incentivization: Providing a layer to compensate contributors providing data or compute resources that power the process supporting decentralized AI functions Foundation Models as Digital Assets The entirety of a foundation model, from input datasets to formation and output artifacts, can be recorded as a digital asset, such that the full process of carrying out any activity can be recorded on a blockchain. The evolution of LLMs, for instance, can have implications on the validity and ease of compromising data. With widespread deployments across multiple foundation models, there are constant updates on their capabilities, such that their features are always evolving. This makes strategic model performance benchmarking crucial, especially ensuring the benchmark is unknown to the model for the process to be effective. From a governance perspective, timestamps can identify the latest version of the model or its underlying data, to maintain consistency of results. An earlier version of a model may not be aware of the latest relevant data, such that asking both an earlier version and the latest version of a foundation model to perform an activity may lead to different results. Blockchain enhances governance of data, AI projects, and processes. Digital assets linked to foundation models can be version governed across their full lifecycle. Foundation models represented as digital assets can also be treated as assets of an entity and better protected or commercialized. For instance, investors with ethics-based frameworks may make more informed decisions when foundation models have the level of certifications and security mechanisms that blockchain technology can provide.

AI REGULATION While regulatory developments specific to AI today are in early stages, it’s imperative to shape the norm of doing things right. AI is becoming front and center in international convenings, including G7 and G20 Summits, and other regional convenings globally. There is ample consensus that regulation needs to be speedy and flexible, given the pace and nature of technological change. Regulation also needs global alignment to minimize regulatory arbitrage, and regulation must aligne with human values of wellbeing. Regulatory approaches around the world range from horizontal regulation, applicable to all AI developments, or vertical regulation, applicable to specific applications or sectors. Horizontal regulations often come from central governments and are at this point in earlier stages of development. Certain jurisdictions have set a precedent in their progress toward regulatory frameworks that have influenced other jurisdictions. This can contribute to harmonization of rules. There is optimism that the US and EU approaches, as major jurisdictions, are evolving toward increasing regulatory alignment. There are also trends toward regional harmonization, as in the African Union case, or the Latin American case which largely follows the EU model. Jurisdictions with more flexible and clear regulations are expected to attract innovations. As regulatory developments for AI continue to take shape, and as AI solutions continue to converge with blockchain capabilities with the intent of responsible and more effective AI, innovators will need to adhere to requirements for AI in the context of other regulations, including those focused on blockchain and digital assets that are also developing in parallel and are generally at more advanced stages globally relative to AI regulations.

The general consensus is that AI regulations in Africa are adopting a horizontal approach, similar to the European Union’s GDPR. Key AI-related issues in Africa include data privacy breaches, algorithmic bias, and a lack of cybersecurity measures. In response, African nations are developing AI policies that prioritize ethical guidelines, data protection regulations, and capacity-building initiatives to address these challenges. On February 29, 2024, AUDA published a draft policy (“the AU Draft Policy”) outlining a framework for AI regulation by member states. This framework provides recommendations for the standards and practices for building, testing, and benchmarking AI systems. It also suggests the establishment of regulatory oversight bodies within the framework. On August 9, 2024, the African Union Executive Council published the Continental AI Strategy. The strategy advocates for a more unified national approach across the public and private sectors of AU member states to navigate the evolving AI landscape, while also strengthening regional and global cooperation. Its goal is to position Africa as a leader in inclusive and responsible AI development. The Continental AI Strategy categorizes AI-related risks into the following four areas: 1. Environmental risks 2. System-level risks (e.g., bias, privacy, and personal data protection) 3. Structural risks (e.g., gender equality, job displacement, the AI divide, and more) 4. Risks to African values (e.g., the spread and manipulation of AI-generated misinformation, disinformation, and hate speech; subversion of Indigenous Knowledge and African cultural heritage; and more) Although it is somewhat challenging to determine the exact level of acceptance of the AU Draft Policy and the Continental AI Strategy, the alignment of national AI strategies with these policy documents is promising.

This effort is encapsulated within the framework of the “Five Trusted Regulatory Industry Sectors,” which includes AI, semiconductors, and next-generation developments in communications, aimed at fortifying Taiwan’s role in global supply chains and discussions aligning with democratic partners. The draft AI Basic Act, introduced to guide the development, application, and regulation of AI technologies, emphasizes principles like sustainable development, data governance, transparency, fairness, and accountability. The act aligns with international standards seen in the U.S., EU, and Singapore, advocating for a balanced approach that fosters innovation while ensuring safety and fairness. The draft proposes a risk-based regulatory framework similar to the EU AI Act, categorizing AI applications by risk levels and promoting innovation through mechanisms like regulatory sandboxes. Additionally, it seeks to establish accountability mechanisms, including certification, testing, and requirements for foreign AI products entering the Taiwanese market. Potential content regulations focus on preventing harms like bias, discrimination, and misleading information from AI applications, suggesting that further laws might be introduced to mitigate risks associated with machine-generated content. The act also emphasizes data protection through “data protection by design and by default,” which could shape future amendments to Taiwan’s Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA). Moreover, it stresses the importance of intellectual property rights in AI training data usage, echoing positions held by the U.S. on copyright considerations. While the draft’s open comment period concluded on September 15, 2024, it remains in the legislative process.

This includes the Artificial Intelligence and Data Act (AIDA), which is unlikely to come into force before 2025. While major tech companies have expressed support for the objectives of Bill C-27, AIDA still requires further work. There is a growing consensus to remove AIDA from Bill C-27, in order to establish clear rules that will enable businesses to confidently deliver AI products and services. The goal is to expedite the creation of a legal framework that fosters responsible AI development. Canada is also continuing efforts to modernize the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), which forms part of the broader effort to pass Bill C-27. This underscores the urgent need to update privacy laws and establish a regulatory framework for responsible AI development in Canada. One of the most significant unresolved issues is how to regulate open-source AI. Many of the proposed regulations are challenging to implement, both from a technical and a political standpoint. United The US approach to AI regulation is sector dependent and rules-based, with no Regulatory States statutes and a state-by-state approach. At a US-wide level, there is an increasing developments in federal focus on AI, with significant expected developments for 2025. The only progress legislation in place is at a state level,5 with New York, California, and Wyoming having established very specific rules. California has had significant activity around the Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Models Act (SB 1047). It is complex to define the concept of “trustworthy AI” which much of the US rhetoric refers to. This concept raises questions like “is it about the inputs, outputs, or transparency of the model?,” or “what features does it specify?” Therefore, it can be challenging in codifying anything values based, just like it can be difficult to keep up with a moving target give the rapid developments in the space. There has been a reliance on case law, often from decades prior, in relation to AI issues. This may still work if the concepts are the same. For instance, companies may be sued for wiretapping when chatbots record user information to optimize their algorithms without informing users. Case law in relation to AI at this point has relied on the Fair Use Doctrine as a backstop, allowing the use of copyrighted materials in certain circumstances without permission. At a federal level, the comprehensive US Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence was released after years of hearings and focused conversations on AI, setting a clear direction toward AI-specific regulatory developments. It establishes a government-wide approach toward responsible AI development and deployment. It set in motion over 100 deliverables and catalyzed activity across US agencies, calling for increased coordination among them. It acknowledges the need to complement efforts and better understand AI before moving more aggressively forward with regulatory developments. The Executive Order recognizes the rapid pace of technological developments and the need to act. Once the expected deliverables are finalized, legislative activity is expected in the following session alongside continued hearings. Congress is expected to take action, as it has been ramping up engagement in a bipartisan way with government actors and stakeholders in the space.

The Congressional AI Caucus, with the objective of educating policymakers on the economic, technological, and social impacts of AI and supporting innovations that benefit Americans, is expected to ramp up its activities in 2025. The US has also released an AI mandate for federal agencies issued in March 2024, in the form of guidance issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to advance responsible acquisition of AI at a government level (OMB M-24-10). This is the first set of government-wide binding requirements for US agencies to implement measures for risk management, governance, and innovation in their acquisition and use of AI. The National Science Foundation (NSF) has also set measures to support AI developments and risk assessments, under the concept of trustworthy AI. There have also been multiple recent amendments to multiple US AI bills, including the Future of Artificial Intelligence Innovation Act of 2024, the AI Advancement and Reliability Act, the GUIDE AI Act. Overall, the US is moving toward a regulatory regime that focuses on innovation and extracting value for individuals, while ensuring consumer protections. Key issues include lessons learned from early Internet developments, in support of open systems as opposed to closed systems, which points to decentralized AI models. This implies open access and use, as well as agency over one’s data. There is support for democratized access, affording opportunities at a greater bandwidth. United Kingdom: The UK has established guidelines on AI, with a policy aimed at fostering innovation while ensuring responsible governance. This approach is part of a broader, outcome-focused strategy underpinned by two key principles: adaptivity and autonomy. The strategy is primarily built on the National AI Strategy (2021), a 10-year plan designed to support the transition to an AI-enabled economy. It aims to ensure that AI benefits all sectors and regions, aligns with the UK government’s objectives of fostering innovation, and safeguards core values while protecting the public through progressive initiatives. This led to the development of the Pro-Innovation Regulatory Approach (2023), which is guided by five key principles: 1. Safety, Security, and Robustness 2. Transparency and Explainability 3. Fairness 4. Accountability and Governance 5. Mechanisms for Contestability and Redress The approach, led by the Department for Science, Innovation, and Technology (DSIT), largely reflects the original proposals and supports practices that can foster safe, ethical AI development across various sectors. It positions the UK as a global leader in artificial intelligence, focusing on promoting innovation, regulating AI responsibly, and encouraging international cooperation for sharing information, ensuring interoperability, and advancing governance. The policy framework also prioritizes the safe, ethical deployment of AI for the benefit of society. It establishes ethical guidelines through organizations such as the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation (CDEI) and the Office for AI, which collaborates with the Office for Science and Technology Strategy (OSTS) to explore how AI can contribute to the UK government’s strategic goals, while ensuring that AI aligns with core values such as privacy, fairness, and inclusivity. While AI offers significant benefits, a key challenge for the Labour government will be addressing public concerns, particularly around regulating AI companies and AI-generated content. Unlike the previous Conservative administration, which somewhat delayed regulation to protect innovation and avoid stagnation, Labour has signaled a more proactive approach. In its manifesto, the Labour Party committed to introducing binding regulations for companies developing the most powerful AI models, reflecting a stronger focus on managing AI risks and ensuring alignment with the government’s strategic objectives. 40", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "page_number": 43, "chunk_id": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50_p43_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241202113952-06'00'"}}

While AI will not replace humans, it is expected that human activities using AI will outperform those that do not adopt the technology. Human intervention and input remain essential in ensuring that AI is used effectively. International and cross-stakeholder cooperation is crucial to ensure that AI benefits humanity in safe, inclusive, and ethical ways. Standards, best practices, and regulations are important steps toward achieving the global coordination needed to deploy AI at scale responsibly. Both guardrails to address risks and incentives to promote the growth of responsible AI models are essential. The role of blockchain technology is becoming increasingly central in advancing trusted AI solutions, especially with the growing emphasis on decentralized AI. In all cases, it is imperative for stakeholders to consider, in addition to AI outcomes and outputs, the broader implications of the technology on human lives. It is therefore important to think beyond immediate use cases and production goals and address more strategic issues: • What broader problem is AI solving? • What are the outcomes of AI, and how do they impact humans? • What incentives should be used to create responsible AI models? • What controls and tests are essential? • How do we address unintended consequences, such as inaccurate conclusions, hallucinations, or other erroneous facts that algorithms may “make up” due to their lack of lived human experience and emotion? Moreover, while AI innovations continue to develop at a rapid pace, and regulatory frameworks and standards are being established to ensure trust, several open questions remain: 41", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "page_number": 44, "chunk_id": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50_p44_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241202113952-06'00'"}}

How can we ensure that AI training is designed to anticipate future outcomes rather than merely reflecting past data? 2. Incentive Structures and Data Attribution: How should incentive structures and payment models be tailored to encourage individuals and entities to contribute data? Additionally, how should entities handle the attribution of data? 3. Intellectual Property and Data Security: Where should the line be drawn between intellectual property rights for data and the need for creative freedom to allow innovative solutions? How should this be managed in cases where users do not give explicit consent to have their data recorded or used (e.g., AI notetakers for virtual calls, chatbots, etc.)? 4. Regulating Unsecured AI: How should unsecured AI systems, in particular, be regulated to mitigate risks? 5. Cross-Jurisdictional Regulation: What regulatory framework should apply when different parties are in different jurisdictions, particularly when AI systems span multiple regions with varying legal requirements? Looking ahead, responsible AI must be deeply connected with human input and insight. It is crucial that humans remain in control, not just as a “human in the loop” in part of the process, but throughout the entire lifecycle of AI—from design and training data to algorithms and final interpretation. Fortunately, current AI auditing practices, often based on if/then logic, are largely in line with existing relevant regulations. In the realm of AI, errors often arise from misinterpretations or conclusions drawn out of context. Only humans possess lived experiences—rich, subjective insights that serve as the ground truth for AI models. By digitizing our physical and lived experiences, we can provide AI with reliable data to stay on course. Data that is interpreted by third parties, derivative data, synthetic data, and some types of metadata are more distanced from the original source and are more likely to misrepresent the truth. Thus, in a world increasingly dominated by AI, humans as “data laborers” will play a critical role in providing the human-grounded truths that enable AI models to course-correct, ensure accuracy, and remain relevant. Ultimately, knowledge is power, and blockchain technology can provide a layer of verified knowledge that is a game-changer for trustworthy AI. Audit trails for verified information will serve as a key risk mitigation measure.

{"text": "SECTION VIII DECENTRALIZED FINANCE (DEFI): OPPORTUNITIES, RISK CONSIDERATIONS, AND KEY PRINCIPLES FOR GROWTH INTRODUCTION Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is a new trend in commerce that has emerged from the onset and maturation of decentralized networks and blockchain technology. At first DeFi focused on ways to leverage blockchain’s programmability, autonomously functioning code to :decentralize” financial activities. This initial foray into traditional finance sought to disrupt and replace the institutions that have traditionally been integral to financial services. As the rise of tokenization expands to encompass various asset types, DeFi has travelled beyond its financial roots, paving the way for innovation across a broad range of financial and commercial markets. This shift brings exciting possibilities, such as enhanced liquidity, broader access to global markets, and entirely new forms of value exchange. However, it also introduces challenges, including regulatory uncertainties, risks of technical vulnerabilities, and the potential for market manipulation. What exactly defines this new trend, and how might its opportunities and risks shape the future of finance and commerce? This paper explores the meaning of DeFi, and presents a taxonomy of DeFi concepts, as well as a set of common principles and standards to address the novel issues that DeFi presents. Based on those principles, the paper then proposes a mapping of potential risks and mitigation measures for different types of participants in the DeFi space, followed by a regulatory commentary to identify gaps where there may be no principles or regulatory clarity to address issues of concern that DeFi may raise. Throughout the paper, we identify several common misconceptions about DeFi, and attempt to dispel them with simplified explanations that provide context and clarity. This paper also seeks to identify what matters most to DeFi protocols for their activities to be legitimized and scale, while recognizing the frenetic pace of DeFi developments. It raises open questions, and provides recommendations for considering the future of DeFi, which forms an approach toward a DeFi playbook. The reader is encouraged to keep in mind several core themes while reading this paper First, decentralized blockchain networks arguably remove the need for intermediaries, but that does not mean that intermediaries cannot participate nor does it mean that intermediaries may not eventually become a necessary or practical part of DeFi in the future. 45", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "page_number": 48, "chunk_id": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50_p48_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241202113952-06'00'"}}
{"text": "Second, DeFi protocols that utilize decentralized blockchains are automatically global, which means that by design anyone with an internet-connected device can participate. This global access and participation greatly expands the size of the markets but also means that local laws and regulations might be overlooked, or worse, that conflicts between different sovereign laws, standards, and expectations will likely increase. Third, with fewer or no intermediaries, decentralized blockchains and associated protocols rely heavily and sometimes exclusively on infrastructure (software, hardware, and communication). In traditional markets, both financial services and broader commerce, such infrastructure has not typically been subject to much, if any regulation. Drives to change this paradigm just because transactions in assets happen on or through this infrastructure will often involve a fundamental rethinking of long-held legal and regulatory concepts. Fourth, in a world built entirely on software, the code becomes of paramount importance because it functions autonomously such that it cannot be stopped or the results of its execution changed. This is not necessarily an argument to regulate the development and deployment of software, but it points to the difficulties associated with determining how to regulate DeFi and reminds us that software suffers from imperfections. Creating incentives to encourage people to code and test carefully and thoroughly, and to solve these imperfections, seem worthy goals. DEFI OVERVIEW The DeFi movement often points to a new paradigm for financial services, which can be automated and recorded on a decentralized blockchain. It results from the use of software and emerging technology to facilitate direct, point-to-point value exchange between counterparties, and removal of third party intermediaries. Composable financial services can be carried out through automated transactions enabled by smart contracts that use digital assets including stablecoins as the form of currency. It is not clear that a universally adopted definition of “DEFi” exists yet. While definitions and common understanding are still evolving, the industry has made progress toward a functional meaning of DeFi. Let’s start with the foundations in the very name: • Decentralized: no single point of failure, no single source of truth, no single authority capable of or responsible for making changes to data • This is a natural continuation of trends towards greater automation, leveraging developments in computing, the internet, and global connectivity • Finance: traditional financial services activities such as trading, lending, deposit-taking, custody but with tokenized assets DeFi does not exclusively involve financial instruments because any asset or bundle of rights can be tokenized and subjected to the functionality of a traditional financial instrument or transaction. …which lead us to a starting DeFi-nition: Take traditional financial services activities such as trading and lending, distill them into their component rules and processes, and convert them into self-executing code on decentralized 46", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "page_number": 49, "chunk_id": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50_p49_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241202113952-06'00'"}}
{"text": "networks accessible to anyone with an internet-connected device such that any tokenized asset can be utilized on them. Layering on, “DeFi commonly refers to the provision of financial products, services, activities, and arrangements that use distributed ledger technology (DLT), including self-executing code referred to as smart contracts DeFi aims to operate in a disintermediated and decentralized manner, eliminating some traditional financial intermediaries and centralized institutions, and enabling certain direct investment activities.”1 (IOSCO) Misconception 1: “DeFi is the opposite of TradFi (Traditional Finance)” Reality: Rather than attempting to do away with TradFi, DeFi signifies a move towards straight-through processing and universal access to markets with enhanced efficiency and inclusivity, including the ability to subject non-financial assets to those markets. While DeFi arose outside of TradFi and proposes alternative ways to solve problems, including some of the longstanding problems and risk associated with intermediaries (such as counterparty risk), its aim is to make marketplace processes as simple as possible by automating them and removing the need for intermediaries. DeFi also enables integration with TradFi using features like smart contracts, tokenization, and decentralized lending features. DeFi does not remove third parties altogether but allows them access through smart contract integrations. In many cases there can be an integration with an existing centralized TradFi player. For instance, as banks are integrated with a central stock exchange and need its approval to allow trading in traditional assets, they would need to follow a similar process to allow clients who choose to use them to access new protocols. Similarly, for DeFi protocols to integrate tokenized versions of traditional assets, there would need to be at least some integration with traditional players and central exchanges. With tokenization presenting opportunities for markets and liquidity, from event tickets and art to private credit, intellectual property and beyond, innovative business models will have to adapt to these changes. How does this work? DeFi essentially takes the concept of a traditional financial services activity, such as exchange trading or lending, and breaks it down into basic components. It then recreates that activity in a way that shifts several core traditional functions from centralized market intermediaries to allow individual participants to conduct the activity on their own, on a peer-to-peer basis. Any individual with an Internet connection can access existing DeFi applications or build new ones using open-source code. This open structure has generated a truly global liquidity pool deposited by participants, with which an increasing amount of financial and commercial trading activities are taking place, all by means of automated systems that permit peer-to-peer interactions between counterparties. DeFi can be envisioned as a “tech stack” that starts with a decentralized blockchain layer on which everything else is built, a Layer 1 comprising basic protocols that allow for the deployment of smart contracts, which create the rules for automating transactions and activities.

{"text": "Misconception #2: “DeFi is all about financial markets and financial instruments and is not accessible to all” Reality: A participant can use any type of token in a DeFi protocol, so long as it is of a configuration, such as ERC20, recognized by the protocol. Layer 1 tokens, governance tokens and memecoins are some examples, as are tokenized stocks, event tickets and trading cards. All assets can be used in DeFi because the software does not differentiate based on the nature of the asset. DeFi essentially allows any activity involving the decentralized trading of assets over blockchain technology, allowing the possibility of activities that are not related to financial instruments but any asset or item tokenized using blockchain technology. For instance, the regenerative finance (ReFi) movement, considered an offshoot of DeFi, proposes an alternative financial system centered on inclusivity, transparency, and responsibility relative to society and the environment to create net positive effects through regeneration. Another example that can morph into DeFi can be the emerging Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) trend, which enables a blockchain-based network using cryptocurrency incentives to create and maintain physical infrastructure. Misconception #3: “Smart contracts are real contracts and are safe because they are automated” Reality: Smart contracts are nothing more than self-executing code. They are not inherently legally binding contracts, although they could be depending on the facts and circumstances. Moreover, they are not smart in the sense that they do not foresee variations or context apart from the conditions built into them to execute a transaction automatically. They do not account for unforeseen or unanticipated future events that could affect the technology’s function or the participants’ needs. Therefore, there will always be potential gaps and loopholes, scenarios that smart contracts will “miss” or not account for. It is in the time stamping element on which the safety of smart contracts can be relied. Smart contracts also have a series of vulnerabilities, including operational risks (e.g., insufficient backup, lack of critical system safeguards, poor governance), technological risks including unintended technological (e.g., vulnerabilities in the code, human mistakes in coding, issues with oracles or sources of information they rely on), cybersecurity risks, and fraud and manipulation (e.g., nefarious code, backdoors). The code may have vulnerabilities to being controlled, and human mistakes may be difficult to reverse if funds are sent to the wrong recipient.

Regulatory Uncertainty Standards Governance Interoperability Decentralized Governance Interoperability is essential to performing seamless settlements, as the DeFi space often requires exchanging assets of value across chains. Otherwise, when this is not possible beyond a single DeFi protocol, there may be a need to utilize traditional methods. In the traditional approach, one can call upon the example of customers using Visa or Mastercard to settle payments across various systems globally. The DeFi space has achieved collaboration between participants with alliances, public blockchain systems, and secure mechanisms to transact across chains such as bridging technologies. While there are multiple ways to resolve this interoperability need, fragmentation stil exists and a need to ensure an entirely seamless flow of transactions. Moreover, as we move to a multipolar financial system with multiple centers of major activity, it becomes even more important for all participants globally to be in alignment for settlement. Some ways interoperability is being addressed include: • Decentralized Compute: Blockchain technology can distribute computing power in a secure manner across multiple nodes, enabling networks to rely on multiple servers or data centers to support parallel processing and enhance scalability. This can also make use of underutilized resources at a global level. • Artificial Intelligence: AI can automate procedures, improve security, and enhance decision making in DeFi.

Governance From a governance standpoint, DeFi has introduced community-driven decision-making structures through the use of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (“DAOs”). When properly deployed, and at scale, voting and polling, with the use of governance tokens, is meant to ensure stability, efficiency, and agreement on a wide range of topics. Responsible governance and environmental accountability at the Layer 1 level can trickle down throughout the DeFi ecosystem. Governance mechanisms are still not standardized across the ecosystem and there are many challenges associated with various governance models. When governance undermines decentralization, various risks arise. IN THE ABSENCE OF REGULATION, RISK MANAGEMENT Most major jurisdictions lack clear regulatory frameworks for DeFi. Policy makers and regulators do not have a ready toolkit for how to regulate autonomously functioning code that allows all asset types to trade together on a peer-to-peer basis (that is, without intermediaries). These three core features of DeFi stand in contrast to traditional market and regulatory paradigms in most of the world. In fact, DeFi often looks and behaves much more like general commerce (which may offer a more appropriate lens for analysis), than financial regulation. Nor does the laissez-faire approach to software, hardware and communications technologies provide an easy paradigm for activities involving trading, lending, creation of commodity and other derivatives in a mixed asset, automatic and unintermediated commercial environment. As a result, legislators and regulators are still grappling with how to regulate and where regulation is needed. Without regulatory clarity or a useful toolbox, how should participants act? We propose active, informed risk management. The following sections lay out the different participants and activities core to various types of DeFi protocols and seeks to identify the associated risks. There is a lot of ground to cover and different participants will make their own judgments about what is important to them.

Rather, it lays the foundation for thinking about risk and therefore perhaps about regulation.

DEFI ACTIVITIES AND RISK ASSESSMENT APPROACH There are different categories of participants in the DeFi universe. Some are already regulated, either under traditional regulatory regimes or newer, cryptoasset-specific regulatory approach like Europe’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation. Others are not subject to direct regulation. In order to better identify DeFi risks, it is important to begin with identifying what constitutes a DeFi activity, for which we propose a categorization of DeFi activities that have arisen across traditional and non- traditional spheres of financial services. The aim is to identify activities that can be considered true “DeFi” services, to address the question of what makes something “DeFi” in nature. Each category below specifies examples of platforms offering a range of DeFi services, or allowing their customers to access DeFi services. Note that the actual peer-to-peer individual users are not included as a category or within any category, but they can have significant impact on DeFi in a variety of ways, not least because they provide liquidity and trading interest. They can also be responsible for manipulations and gaming, as well as hacks and other exploits. Because there are multiple laws about these kinds of bad actions, we do not cover them separately in the risk assessment. One unique aspect about DeFi is the market forces and economic realities that drive demand for, and creation of, solutions to perceived problems. Because the code is usually open source and anyone can launch a protocol that fixes issues, market participants can react almost in real-time to create more fairness, predictability and efficiency when something is identified. This analysis proposes a high-level approach toward identifying and mitigating risks for DeFi activities across different categories. These risks may range from financial, operational, consumer protection, and regulatory risks. The examples below identify risks, obligations, and issues specific to these categories of services involved in the DeFi ecosystem, as well as mitigation measures. 53", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "page_number": 56, "chunk_id": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50_p56_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241202113952-06'00'"}}
{"text": "Category 1: Traditional Regulated Entities As Centralized Finance (CeFi) dips its toes into DeFi, traditional regulated entities have already begun using DeFi on behalf of clients or providing clients with access to DeFi protocols. For those already regulated entities, an approach toward risk assessments for DeFi services can start with referring to existing standards and how they apply to traditionally regulated entities. The entities listed below have clearly defined responsibilities mandated by regulation or industry standards. If they are to successfully adopt or use DeFi, they need to figure out how those responsibilities apply in the DeFi context of autonomously functioning code. For instance, major global banks assisting clients to access DeFi protocols are expected to assume responsibility for some aspect of connecting them, especially when it involves retail clients. When it comes to risk, it is important to consider that there is a difference between centralized and decentralized technologies, and a difference between tokenized financial instruments and other asset types.

{"text": "Category 2: Registered Legal Entities Offering Digital Asset Services Legal entities offering digital asset products and services are subject to obligations specified by the jurisdictions in which they are registered to operate. These entities include businesses considered to be crypto-native, offering products and services tailored for the digital asset industry, without directly operating a DeFi protocol. For instance, centralized digital asset exchanges, trading utilities and custodians (including custodial wallet providers) may provide their clients access to DeFi protocols, by trading the assets of, or on behalf of clients in DeFi protocols or providing gateways to such trading. Other entities may provide the basic tooling utilized by DeFi protocols, such as stablecoins. While these businesses may already provide customers with digital asset opportunities, such as efficiencies for trading alternatives in private markets, DeFi provides opportunities for these customers, adding value to their existing offerings. As these entities increase their engagement in DeFi activities, they should have responsibilities with respect to their customers just as for their other client offerings. The jurisdictions where the entities are registered and/or licensed may provide stringent or lax requirements for their operations, which can have implications on their overall reliability and risks. On the other hand, these businesses may also be operating without formal licenses, and as such be outside the purview of any regulation. In many cases, it will be important to better define what these services mean in the DeFi ecosystem, and how these entities should envision their obligations to their clients.

These are interfaces and pure technology providers, in a decentralized context where no single entity or authority is responsible for events taking place, in keeping with the definition presented at the beginning of this paper. By removing intermediaries, DeFi protocols shift trust from third parties to the protocol itself. A new layer of smart contract risk, which is essentially programming risk plus the risk of “gaming” the system, arises when relying on purely automated functionality. Access also depends on how protocols are set up, which can have implications on risk. The nature of digital assets being exchanged over DeFi platforms also has implications on risk, as do common utilities utilized, such as the availability of data or interoperability mechanisms, including bridge technologies. 56", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "page_number": 59, "chunk_id": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50_p59_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241202113952-06'00'"}}
{"text": "Defi protocols raise the question of whether there is there anyone “running the shop” who should have clear obligations to users and/or who should be regulated. While the applications themselves and the software developers behind them may not be regulated, there still need to be risk assessment considerations for these purely technology-enabled DeFi activities as suggested below. In this context, risk will depend on the activity in question. For instance, smart contracts have programming risks and other vulnerabilities. Websites may have flaws that allow bad actors to steal private keys to take control of funds. Moreover, for smaller businesses developing digital solutions, up-front costs and necessary integrations can present risks when there is uncertainty in the market, such as attempting to bank the unbanked. An important subcategory of this section comprises DAOs, which play a critical role in the DeFi space when introduced for governance. DAOs may not be legal entities in the traditional sense and yet can have a certain level of responsibility associated with a DeFi protocol. Even while operating outside of clear regulatory obligations, the creation of clear roles and responsibilities that should be considered. While most jurisdictions have not yet devised ways of categorizing DAOs, the US State of Wyoming has developed in its laws two different versions of DAO structures. One is similar to a traditional limited liability company (“LLC”), and the other resembles an unincorporated association. The contours of each type are yet to be fully explored. Certain proposed legislation in the U.S. Congress also has sought to address certain requirements for DAOs (e.g., taxation). And, at least U.S. courts are beginning to recognize DAOs as “general partnerships,” which (unfortunately for DAO participants) imposes joint and several liability for the acts of the DAO upon each and every DAO participant equally. This “general partner liability” could create significant challenges for the future adoption of DAO approaches to activities that carry significant risk exposure.

In DeFi, security protocols can be put in place, including AML/ KYC and other compliance measures, to provide safe ways of exchanging funds. These measures are particularly important when removing intermediaries, and when integrating tokenized traditional assets with DeFi protocols. In some cases, data may be collected and made accessible only to regulators upon request. That said, this area remains subject to development and discussion. We expect developments here in the coming years. Insights drawn from tracking and tracing technologies have shown a relatively low (or at least comparable) incidence of money laundering in the space. While the data reveals growth in illicit funds sent into DeFi protocols, alongside a reduction in illicit services, this is in the context of DeFi’s overall growth in market size. On the other hand, the transparency of fund flows in DeFi makes it harder to obscure fund movements.4 58", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "page_number": 61, "chunk_id": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50_p61_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241202113952-06'00'"}}

{"text": "REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS With respect to regulatory risks and expected regulatory requirements, many open questions remain stemming from DeFi’s core of automonous functioning, multi-asset, peer-to-peer nature and how associated activities would properly fit into existing regulatory regimes and expectations. Given that that DeFi protocols and platforms are regulated more by the market than by supervisors and have arisen outside the purview of regulatory supervision, a proper risk assessment seems foundational to any eventual requirements policy makers might seek to impose. For centuries, the government has regulated intermediaries, not the individuals that design them, or the direct counterparties in peer-to-peer interactions. The implicit assumption is that individuals and counterparties would be in danger of third parties doing them wrong. Regulated activity, therefore, is designed to include the intermediaries all along the chain of custody based on traditional models. Yet DeFi presents a new model that essentially eliminates the traditional players that governments would regulate. Annex 3 below lists regulatory developments globally for DeFi thus far. As an alternative, the space can start with a self-governance perspective, with structured standards and rubrics for adequate risk assessment and mitigation measures. These standards have made progress identifying best practices that, in the context of several enforcement actions against DeFi protocols in the last few years, could make many DeFi protocols more acceptable to regulators. Misconception #5: All DAOs are fully decentralized and autonomous Reality: DAOs come in all shapes and sizes, with their founders making decisions about how they function that may result in an organization that is not truly decentralized or autonomous, or indeed is (as a functional matter) fully centralized. It depends on the architecture and how tokens are distributed, as well as the voting process and other elements of governance. Moreover, few people may in fact read the smart contract behind a DAO, which can become a seemingly black box. Similarly, they may not fully understand their potential exposure to the “general partnership” liability described above. Reread the definition of decentralized at the start of this paper for a framework to think about whether a DAO is decentralized. DAOs may have a treasury of funds separate from the voting group, which votes on different issues with tokens. If a single entity or a few entities hold a majority of tokens or control decisions in any other form, they essentially have decision making power regardless of how other token holders may vote or what they want. If there are no rules for minimum voting periods, or minimum timeframes from when a vote passes to when a decision is executed over a smart contract, decisions may be determined easily by a few or a single player when not everyone has had the time to vote. If the mechanisms to overrule a single entity casting a majority vote, decentralization may be a mirage. In fact, litigators have in some rare cases recovered funds from unwilling DAOs. In these cases, these DAOs were not fully autonomous. When one person is the majority token holder, litigation can force them to pay for injustices using traditional measures and standard legal principles. 61", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "page_number": 64, "chunk_id": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50_p64_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241202113952-06'00'"}}
{"text": "CONCLUSION DeFi does not fit comfortably within existing frameworks because it involves autonomously functioning code with transaction finality, multiple asset classes and no central authority or gatekeeper. Peer-to-peer activity is paramount. It also currently suffers from a lack of clear definitions, categorization of actors and activities, and standardization. One might argue that all these features are actually good. They show creative disruption and experimentation on an unprecedented scale, which will drive markets and commerce to better, more global solutions. On the other hand, just like blockchains provide certainty and predictability, it might be important for DeFi to accomplish those goals. To that end, below is a repository of open questions that the space is addressing, followed by a set of recommendations and considerations for DeFi developments moving forward. The goal at this point is not to specify regulation, which would lead to a jurisdiction specific analysis at too preliminary of a stage, but instead to point to areas that standards might cover. The implications of these questions, considerations and recommendations can then point to specific needs such as new legislation or regulatory developments, new interpretations of such, or necessary exemptions, new sets of expectations, or new technologies (e.g., decision makers investing in analytics solutions tailored for the space). Open Regulatory Questions for DeFi 1. What constitutes a true DeFi activity? 2. How do DeFi activities fit into existing regulated activities, if at all? 3. For those DeFi activities that may not fit into existing regulations, what are the regulatory expectations for them, and can DeFi protocols satisfy them? 4. What is the appropriate role of government and regulation in a context where there are no intermediaries? Does current law address this effectively in any way? 5. Is having an intermediary sufficient to require regulation? To whom should this point, and what does it mean to remove intermediaries? 6. Should any DeFi protocols, or any elements of protocols (e.g., Dexes) be treated as intermediaries? 7. What makes a financial intermediary, especially for the purposes of being held liable as such? 8. How should regulation address data subjects and counterparties when there are no intermediaries? 9. Who should be held responsible when something goes wrong in the context of no intermediaries? 10. What functionalities should DeFi participants ensure in order to be considered acceptable by regulators and prevent enforcement actions? 11. Should the same principles apply for all DeFi participants, or should there be different rules for different participants? 12. How should regulation address DAOs? Should they be considered legal entities in relation to the law? 13. How to deal with potential “general partnership liability” for DAO actions and activities? 14. What should risk assessments for DeFi entail? 15. What considerations and obligations to customers should DeFi participants be required to have? 16. Should regulators stay out of or lean into regulating the industry? 17. What are the implications of imposing penalties on direct participants (individuals and counterparties), as opposed to exchanges, mixers, and other services? 62", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "page_number": 65, "chunk_id": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50_p65_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241202113952-06'00'"}}

Should protocols that provide access to those interfaces be regulated for doing so (e.g., wallet providers)? Where will that end up, if we regulate all layers of access? 19. Should contract participants follow rules to be considered eligible to carry out a transaction? Should a transaction involving an ineligible contract participant be allowed in any circumstance? 20. Should smart contracts be regulated as brokers for carrying out order routing activities, etc.? 21. What new changes does DeFi bring, how do they affect markets, and what would be the implications if DeFi were to scale? 22. Does fully a permissionless and trustless system truly exist, and should it? Recommendations and a Skeletal Playbook for DeFi 1. Providing clear definitions in this ecosystem is imperative as a first step to define roles and responsibilities for DeFi players. a. There may be a need to define the necessary elements of a DAO in order to merit that name. b. A definitional exercise will help the space to identify and approach entities, or subcategories of such, that should or should not be covered by rules 2. Define what standards should be in place for DeFi, and what categories of activity they should apply to, as a precursor for regulation a. Define what categories of DeFi activities should be subject to specific standards and best practices, in the absence of regulation at this point 3. Consider that DeFi players, including DAOs, may have a certain level of responsibility will require a certain amount of regulation and what determines when that level is met. a. To determine DeFi players’ considerations and obligations to customers, understand what part of the protocol is in question (e.g., smart contract executing transactions, website customers use to access smart contract). b. For specific issues (e.g., IP, tax schemes, etc.), consider the actual allocator in a project. c. Consider the scope of traditional players and legal entities participating in DeFi, and their regulatory requirements. d. Assess the relevance of existing regulations (e.g., regulations for issuance of assets, residence/ jurisdiction of defi users, KYC requirements to trade in tokenized assets, etc.) 4. Acknowledge that the activity makes the cases, considering the particular facts and circumstances rather than making sweeping claims. Tokens are separate from the entities and activities using them. 5. If DeFi services replace traditional financial services and processes, they must also be effective at protecting the markets they serve. Define measures for effective AML, protections against fraud, sanctions compliance, and other existing safeguards 6. Implement risk assessments for all types of DeFi activities, identifying the topics they would address and the expectations they give rise to. 7. Consider measures for governance and dispute resolution across categories of DeFi activities 8. Consider services for AML/KYC, verifications, and consumer protection measures. a. For instance, protocols may require participants to use secondary digital identity solutions to prove they are not bankrupt, not in a sanctioned country, and have not been convicted of a crime. b. Zero knowledge proofs can ensure privacy, and the data can be validated by a legitimate external entity (e.g., US Customs), providing a credentialing solution that any DeFi protocol could accept. 63", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "page_number": 66, "chunk_id": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50_p66_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241202113952-06'00'"}}

Digital Assets in this classification have at least one or more of the features captured in the categories, but it should be noted that there may be features developed in the future that have not yet been contemplated at this time. Similarly, not all Digital Assets classified here, have all these features.

{"text": "SECTION IX DIGITAL IDENTITY AND BLOCKCHAIN: USE CASES, DIGITAL PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE MODELS, AND KEY PRINCIPLES FOR GROWTH EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Digital Identity systems are essential for services that empower individuals to securely prove their identity and access a wide range of public and private services. Within a dynamic data economy built around data exchange, digital identities must work seamlessly across national boundaries and jurisdictions, be interoperable and resilient, and enable individuals to govern their digital identity. A robust digital identity is a necessity and a catalyst for innovation. It paves the way for transformative use cases in decentralized finance, social services, healthcare, and other domains. The emergence of the need for a high-assurance digital identity in many countries is a testament to its potential. The current state of affairs in these use cases is plagued by data duplication, low data quality, loss and leakage during service delivery, loss of benefits, exclusion, and forgery of digital identity. A robust digital identity can address these issues and unlock possibilities. INTRODUCTION It is essential to highlight that digital identities are not limited to individuals. Businesses also use digital identities to establish bona fide relationships and exchange verifiable information. While the term “digital identity” implies a transformation from traditional forms of identification and authentication (such as printed ID cards, passports, etc.), there is much confusion around the definition of the term itself. The Wikipedia entry1 for the term describes it as “A digital identity is data stored on computer systems relating to an individual, organization, application, or device. For individuals, it involves the collection of personal data that is essential for facilitating automated access to digital services, confirming one’s identity on the internet, and allowing digital systems to manage interactions between different parties. It is a component of a person’s social identity in the digital realm, often referred to as their online identity. While this term is reasonably complete, it needs more insights into the capabilities of a digital identity. The UK government has published a UK Digital Identity Attributes and Trust Framework document where it defines a digital identity2 as 69", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "page_number": 72, "chunk_id": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50_p72_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241202113952-06'00'"}}

They can use it online or in person.” For this document, we will consider a digital identity to be “A digital representation that enables people, organizations and things to present trustworthy data when interacting digitally.” Digital trust company Sezoo3 published this definition in the paper “Trustworthy digital identities as a foundation for digital trust”4 (PART 1) DIGITAL IDENTITY & USE CASES: WHAT IS THE NEED FOR DIGITAL IDENTITY? A fact often highlighted in any discussion around digital identities is that nearly a billion people do not have any verifiable identity or other legal documentation. The absence of such papers significantly encumbers, especially for underrepresented and marginalized communities, the ability to access services, seek employment, or discover ways to improve their way of life. In a digitally connected world that depends on digital transactions, the absence of trustworthy digital identities leads to exclusion and exploitation. It exacerbates the magnitude and consequences of a digital divide between those with access and those without access to networks of productivity. A foundational digital identity presents a form of “root of trust” that can be recognized by other entities and stakeholders in an ecosystem. Such recognition also establishes the acceptance of the assertions made by the individual through the digital identity they consent to share, which allows access to participate in the economic, legal and political aspects of the ecosystem or network.

{"text": "The digital transformation of society has led to explosive growth in transactions that depend on reliable and trustworthy data exchange. Access to such high-trust data is now essential to the value-creation system. Therefore, data bound in some form to reliable digital identities is a critical component for governance, business and regulatory functions. The various use cases of digital identity demonstrate a fundamental need to create, issue and manage reliable digital identities, which offer the holders/principals/subjects the capability to mitigate the risks emanating from poorly designed data flow systems, and even data security breaches. (1.1) FORMS OF DIGITAL IDENTITY Digital identity refers to the use of data, represented and utilized as a digital identifier, identify an individual or entity. These identifiers can refer to the following broad categories: 1. Persons (Personal Identity) • Definition: This refers to an individual’s unique identity used in the digital world for various personal activities. • Usage: For social media interactions, personal communications, and accessing non-work- related online services. • Examples: Social media profiles, email accounts, user IDs for personal apps. This also includes digital versions of government-issued IDs (e.g., e-passports, digital driver’s licenses, national ID cards). 2. Employees of the Company / Organization • Definition: The digital identity assigned to an individual by their employer, representing them as part of an organization. • Usage: For accessing company systems, conducting business tasks, and collaborating on projects. • Examples: Work email addresses, employee ID numbers, login credentials for work platforms. 3. Legal Identities (Legal Entity Identifiers - LEI) • Definition: A unique, standardized code that identifies businesses and organizations in financial and legal transactions. • Examples of LEI in Use: i. International Trade: A shipping company uses its LEI to facilitate cross-border transactions, ensuring compliance with global trade regulations. ii. Banking: A financial institution verifies the LEI of a corporate client before opening a business account. iii. Investments: An asset management firm uses LEIs to identify counterparties in securities transactions. iv. Tax Reporting: A multinational corporation includes its LEI in regulatory tax filings to comply with international standards. v. Regulatory Compliance: A startup registers for an LEI to participate in financial markets and report transactions to regulators like the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). 4. As Internet of Things (IoT) • Definition: Digital identities associated with connected devices and machines that communicate over the internet. • Usage: For device authentication, remote control, data sharing, and security management in smart environments. • Examples: Smart home devices, industrial IoT devices, wearable tech with unique device identifiers. 71", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "page_number": 74, "chunk_id": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50_p74_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241202113952-06'00'"}}
{"text": "When it comes to individuals, digital identity can also take several forms and attributes, of which we highlight the most common below: Foundational Identity: This refers to the general concept of a basic identifier, generally at a national level, that can be used to access a wide range of services offered by the public and private sector, and also engage in related transactions. A foundational identification system is to manage the identity data for the general population, providing credentials to serve as proof of identity to access such services and transactions. Increasingly, foundational identity systems are adopting digital formats. Source: https://id4d.worldbank.org/guide/types-id-systems Derived Identity: In some cases, where a state-mandated national ID has yet to be slowly rolled out, bank IDs have become repurposed to provide a set of high-quality digital identifiers that can be linked to and integrated into many other services. These services do not have to be banking-related; many non-banking use cases have also emerged building on the basic digital identifiers provided by banks. In some cases, the interactions and transactions of the ID holder provide a good proxy for the notion that a derived ID can be attested and certified by external or third parties. Therefore, derived identity can serve as a proxy for a foundational identity that may not exist. Biometric Identity: The unique biological characteristics of individuals can be used to verify their identity. These attributes can be biological characteristics (e.g., fingerprints, iris scans, facial recognition, veins, and shapes of body parts like ears, hand geometry, or even odor or DNA attributes) or behavioral attributes (e.g., voice, signature, keystroke patterns, or patterns in gestures, walking, or other movements). Biometric authentication is invoked when a select number of unique biological traits are used to verify a person’s identity. In some digital identity systems, especially those related to high-trust and high-assurance data exchange use cases, the user enrollment workflow also includes registering biometric information. Many of the largest identity projects include a biometric component. Biometrics may be considered more accurate than other forms of identity because they are inherently tied to the individual. Biometric characteristics, as opposed to passwords and other 72", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "page_number": 75, "chunk_id": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50_p75_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241202113952-06'00'"}}

Many national identity and immigration or border crossing records rely on biometrics. Security is of utmost importance for this form of identity because any personal data stolen through a breach would be nearly impossible to reverse. As opposed to changing a password, we cannot change the shape of our fingerprint. Therefore, the risks and overall downside of biometric identity (e.g., violation of privacy rights, high costs, invasive format) in many cases may not make this form of identity worthwhile because they may not be outweighed by the benefits. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI): The main challenge with a digital identity has always been to implement it safely and correctly. This usually means that the digital identity protects the holder’s privacy, does not lead to exclusion, and functions in a way safe enough to prevent unwanted surveillance by correlating usage patterns of the digital identifier. Over time, self-sovereign identity (SSI) principles6 have provided a working framework for designing, deploying, and managing a digital identity system where identity holders have the power and sovereignty over their own identities. These principles focus on the digital identity holder’s agency, autonomy, and integrity. Figure 2: 12 Principles of SSI from the Sovrin Foundation CANADA’S DIGITAL SELF-SOVEREIGN IDENTITY FRAMEWORKS In recent years Canada has led in the adoption of SSI based approach to digital identity and the creation of a regulatory framework which enables user-centric approach to the governance of such identifiers. 73", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "page_number": 76, "chunk_id": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50_p76_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241202113952-06'00'"}}

Enabling individuals and businesses to prove their identity and share verified information through digital means. This approach is built around offering security, efficiency, convenience for the holder of the digital credentials. However, as this is an emerging technology landscape there are downsides to rapid adoption in the form of enabling robust cybersecurity, ensuring inclusiveness and equity through accessibility features, managing privacy and the overarching reliance on technology through the digital transformation process. Digital ID generally offers greater protections from ID theft and leaks of sensitive info in boosting privacy. But concerns include data collection, who can access this data and how it’s used, as well as location tracking, and questions around potential for government tracking. The Privacy Act and the Digital Governance Council of Canada standardized framework (PCTF) define a duty of care that citizens, clients and customers should expect while using modernized digital services.

Work is underway to further explore applications, including Digital Business Licences, Digital Certificate of Qualification, Digital Home-Owner Credential. (1.2) DIGITAL ID AND BLOCKCHAIN Blockchain, a technology usually more recognised for cryptocurrency moorings, has been pivotal for the adoption of SSI models. It has expanded access to underserved communities and enhanced the privacy and security of personal information. More importantly, it has empowered the holders to have more control over their data, enabling a significant shift in the digital landscape of activities. Today, we see digital identities becoming the focal point of discussion when designing digital transformation policies globally, including those spearheaded by member states in the EU, and a wide range of programs currently developing and rolling out national ID projects in countries such as Bhutan7. The Modular Open Source Identity Platform (MOSIP)8 project has enabled the implementation and adoption of digital identity as an open-source Digital Public Good (DPG)9. This approach has lowered the cost of digital identity deployment and encouraged many more countries to pivot toward creating the necessary business, legal and technical frameworks for successful digital identity rollouts. In many cases, good biometric technology is a key binding element to digital identities, especially doing so in a manner that enables the person to have more agency, control, and autonomy. DIGITAL ID CAN BE A CORNERSTONE OF A REAL-TIME ECONOMY Digital Identity is fundamental to an ecosystem where economic transactions, processes, and activities occur in real-time or near real-time, as facilitated by blockchain technology. This is enabled by digital technologies and instantaneous data flows, allowing businesses, governments, and individuals to interact and make decisions with minimal latency. Key characteristics include automation, integration of systems, and immediate processing of payments, reporting, and other economic activities. Digital identity is a cornerstone of the Real-Time Economy, as it facilitates seamless, secure, and efficient transactions. 75", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "page_number": 78, "chunk_id": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50_p78_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241202113952-06'00'"}}

Self-managed data, for instance, can be flexible and take several forms. Deterministic data refers to an exact value (e.g., Identity card number) that leaves no margin of error in matching a person to an identifier. On the other hand, biometric data uses a probabilistic mechanism to match a person to an identifier (e.g., fingerprints). The patterns detected on a biometric record (e.g., past fingerprint image) may have a margin of error with respect to the biometric information provided by the person in real time (current fingerprint image capture). Therefore, there must be a tolerance value that must be considered. ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR BIOMETRIC IDENTITY Biometrics are being gradually introduced at scale, such as at border checkpoints, thus intersecting with traveler experience and a broad range of activities in which such identities are used. Many of these interactions primarily include Facial Recognition Technologies (FRTs).

{"text": "under the Face Recognition Technology Evaluation (FRTE), among many related initiatives and standards underway, which are meant to ensure the accurate and measurable quality of biometric data readings such as FRTs. At the moment a person opens an online account, the identity verification process involves a form of device binding to the credentials utilized, ensuring the device acting on behalf of a person is actually owned by that real person and not someone else claiming to be that individual. An essential driver of binding biometric information during digital identity enrollment is the capability to use a mobile device-centric user experience during the data exchange stage. The Digital Identity Guidelines from NIST10 (800-63-4, available for public comments until 7th October 2024) include a comprehensive set of aspects around the management of risks and determination of impact levels around the measures of risks for enrollment into a digital identity service. ETHICAL CHALLENGES FOR BIOMETRIC IDENTITY: COMPLIANCE, SECURITY, AND TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS A recent case highlighting the importance of ethical considerations has been the emergence of projects like WorldCoin, and subsequently the Orb project, which have become highly controversial in providing technology to capture biometrics to build reusable digital identities. After a high-profile rollout that was deemed to be non-compliant with local regulatory requirements, many countries have decided to revisit this approach and stopped further citizen enrollment using WorldCoin technology. WorldCoin implementations didn’t consider the legal requirements in the countries where they launched operations, leading to heavy regulatory scrutiny and investigations. There is sufficient research11 12 13 that acquiring biometric data and enabling binding requires regulatory approvals and oversight. An important lesson learned from the response of various national governments to the approach adopted by WorldCoin is that a launch at a global scale must be compliant in all jurisdictions in which operations are to take place. This requires strategic considerations around security, both with respect to data and the applications themselves. Another ongoing challenge with using biometric technology for identity binding during the enrolment process of creating a digital identifier is creating adequate guardrails against unintended consequences14. Since biometric technology- based authentication is often the first option for enabling access to the services, selecting good failsafes is crucial. Biometrics are a powerful tool, but they only work adequately if robust security measures can be ensured, given the magnitude of potential downsides (e.g., identity theft compromises uniquely personal information that cannot be replaced). Moreover, biometric authentication which requires fingerprinting, for instance, can also become a barrier when there is a fingerprint mismatch or fingerprints can no longer be read with sufficient accuracy by the hardware used. Robust management of biometric data, preventing such data being accessed at rest or in transit, and ensuring secure encryption technology is essential for adopting biometric based digital identity workflows15. Given the level of digital literacy in a given population, it is essential that workflows which depend on biometric technology provide ways to record informed consent, protect the privacy of the holder and prevent data misuse. 78", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "page_number": 81, "chunk_id": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50_p81_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241202113952-06'00'"}}

AgriFi is built on a unique blockchain infrastructure called ToroNet, specifically designed to solve real-world problems at scale. Toronet26 aims to revolutionize farmers’ market engagement and sovereignty by leveraging digitalization and smart contracts to create fairer, transparent, connected, and inclusive agricultural markets27. The project leverages the full power of tokenization, including zero-knowledge proof KYC technologies, to enable the creation of a digital yet verifiable business profile for farmers, solving the problem of access to capital, inputs, and offtake, all in one place. Aggregate lending pools powered by smart contracts enable farmers to get funded while providing industry-standard insurance and KYC solutions. The money from the lending pools can only be used by farmers to purchase the inputs needed for their crops. At the end of the harvest cycle, the off-takers sell the produce and credit the smart contracts that distribute the revenue to all parties involved. • Decentralized Finance (DeFi) - The optimal function and scaling of DeFi will depend largely on a blockchain-based model of digital identity of participants that is decentralized and self-sovereign. This can provide the right balance between the need for anonymity and the right identifiers to ensure participants are legitimate actors. Individuals can have the burden of proof, providing their information voluntarily. In a self-managed approach, the type of data provided by individual participants can be the differentiating factor. An external party would have to certify the data provided by the individual. Regulatory developments and industry discussions are still underway regarding the role of central authorities and other key stakeholders in an ecosystem that seeks to preserve privacy and anonymity, while also defining adequate rules and requirements. • Global Identity Systems and Standards - Data on individuals and entities can be utilized to carry out verifications, and then white list models to facilitate access to trust services. The importance of privacy preserving zero-trust architecture can be key in these scenarios. Common standards can also define best practices – The Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) is a 20-character, alpha-numeric code based on the ISO17442 standard developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The LEI uniquely identifies legal entities globally. It contains key reference information about the entity (e.g., its local registration number and registration authority, legal name, legal address, parent/child entity relationships, etc.), enabling clear and unique identification of legal entities globally. All users can access all the LEI reference data via the GLEIF website for free as an open database.

The Global LEI System is overseen by the Regulatory Oversight Committee of more than 65 regulators and 19 observers from 50 countries. Regulators mandate the LEI in global financial transactions. Currently, over 2.6 million entities in 200+ jurisdictions have LEIs. (PART 2) DIGITAL PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE (DPI) Large-scale deployments of digital identity projects mandate digital infrastructure development, maintenance, and operation. It is essential to consider this, as the state is often the primary sponsor and driver of digital identity initiatives. With technology advancements using public and private cloud infrastructure, it is now possible to design, build, and operate the necessary technology components that interplay to provide a robust consumer experience for digital identity and services associated with digital identity. In recent years, the Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) approach has found considerable success and adoption while designing the infrastructure for digital identity efforts. While there is no commonly accepted definition of “Digital Public Infrastructure”, enough conceptual commonalities exist to help sponsors and stakeholders. WHAT IS DPI? The Centre for Digital Public Infrastructure28 mentions that digital does not require smartphones or connectivity to scale, public-minded yet still crafted to drive private innovation exponentially, and infrastructure is not just an app, a platform or a solution but a minimalist approach to build at a national scale. According to the Centre for Digital Public Infrastructure: Digital Public Infrastructure is an approach to solving socio-economic problems at scale, by combining minimalist technology interventions, public-private governance, and vibrant market innovation. Common examples include the Internet, mobile networks, GPS, verifiable identity systems, interoperable payments networks, consented data sharing, open loop discovery and fulfillment networks, digital signatures, and beyond. This perspective considers that digital public infrastructure (DPI) has core elements such as identifiers and registries, data sharing, credentials and data models, signatures and consent, discovery and fulfilment, and payments. These building blocks span all activities that emerge as possibilities for a robust and scalable digital identity deployment. 81", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "page_number": 84, "chunk_id": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50_p84_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241202113952-06'00'"}}
{"text": "While specific digital identity projects can be open-source and can be a digital public good (DPG - like the open-source MOSIP infrastructure introduced above), the overall technology design which makes a good digital identity worthwhile is Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI). In the design pattern of DPI, the more traditional approach of “platforms” is transformed into “networks”. This ensures that several interconnected and interoperable digital ecosystems can emerge using open standards, open-source software, open protocols and open networks. The DPI approach fully uses digital identifiers and data registries, data exchange and processing (including AI/ML), trust infrastructure, digital payments and discovery and fulfilment. These are the building blocks, and blockchain and digital identity are the essential, foundational components of a DPI. (2.1) DIGITAL IDENTITY AND REGISTRIES Digital identities become meaningful and valuable when the holders can reuse, exchange, or share them to access various services. The data-centric dynamic economy is designed around the consent- based exchange of digital identities and metadata. The digital transformation from legacy systems to digital ones underscores the need to have “trust”. This implies that relying parties can easily verify the digital identity using some authentication. Additionally, as digital identities become more commonly used across sectors, it implies that issuers of digital identities maintain a registry of such digital identifiers. In some instances, such registries are publicly available, driven by the needs of the sectors and digital ecosystems. In other cases, these registries can be private or accessible only to authenticated and authorized entities. These decentralized digital registries, which contain digitally signed data, are a crucial driver to high-trust, low-cost consumption of digital identities for various purposes (such as authentication, KYC flows, civil registries, entity registries, etc.). Many countries are adopting the DPI pattern when transforming services and building data registries, such as civil registries (of births and deaths), registries of attestors and notaries, and so forth. Some leading examples emerge from Brazil, Australia, Singapore, Switzerland, and others. 82", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "page_number": 85, "chunk_id": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50_p85_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241202113952-06'00'"}}
{"text": "(2.2) PRINCIPLES OF DIGITAL PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE Considering the emergence of Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) as a preferred playbook or approach to deploying digital identity solutions, it is essential to examine some fundamental principles. Without a widely understood and commonly accepted definition of DPI, the principles provide a foundation for reviewing the merits of any digital identity infrastructure as a DPI. The Centre for Digital Public Infrastructure has identified five principles that ensure digitization is inclusive, equitable, fair, and scalable. These principles are explained in the illustration below. Digital identity systems should also demonstrate additional values that ensure they are designed to be user-centric and aligned with the requirements of the jurisdiction where the systems operate. Such values should include: • Being human-centric to prevent unintended consequences or harm • Focusing on informed consent to ensure that technology overreach is prevented • Empowering innovation growth and fostering the UN Sustainable Development Goals Digital Strategy of New South Wales (NSW) For example, the government of New South Wales (NSW) announced a Digital Strategy29, which focuses on delivering inclusive and secure digital services to improve residents’ lives. The strategy is built around five missions: • Accessibility - making digital services inclusive and accessible for all people in NSW • Productivity - using digital transformation to advance service delivery • Trust - sustainable digital infrastructure to build trust in government services • Resilience - to deploy infrastructure that is resilient for emergencies • Digital Skills - to uplift the digital capability in the public sector workforce NSW has decided to create a NSW Digital ID and a NSW Digital Wallet to enable individuals to prove their identity while engaging in secure and safe digital data exchange.

(2.3) DPI AS A BLUEPRINT FOR DIGITAL IDENTITY Digital Public Infrastructure using modular, reusable components enables a blueprint that can be easily adopted and adapted to the needs of any given use case, or even a nation seeking to implement a digital identity system. This flexibility has resulted in improved economics, as many open-source projects can easily fit into the technology requirements of a DPI focused on extensible digital identities. DPIs that adopt open standards and protocols can incubate an ecosystem of digital services that includes private and public sector participants. Adopting open standards is essential to achieving the stated goal of interoperability, particularly data interoperability, as successful scaled DPI deployments of digital identity depend on extensive data exchange systems being established. Digital Public Infrastructure Model in the United States The U.S. Digital Public Infrastructure has evolved over the years, and with the support of advanced technologies, the US was able to successfully link individual IDs (for e.g. Social Security Numbers (SSNs) and International Tax Identification Numbers (ITINs) issued by Homeland Security Department, and Internal Revenue Service, respectively) with nationwide repositories and databases to allow individuals to be identified, authenticated, and authorized to access basic digital ID services such as Financial Institutions / Banking system, housing, taxation, education and healthcare. Legal entities and corporations selling and trading activities are also governed by different government identification mechanisms, such as Tax IDs and Employer Identification Numbers (EINs) issued by Internal Revenue Service, with the former being used to oversee movement in employment activities, and the latter to monitor transactions and for tax reporting purposes. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is one of the key agencies that regulates movement of persons, goods and products. It applies diverse and sophisticated technologies in key airports and customs ports to scan persons, goods and products using their digital ID and permit details. Some of the advanced technologies that CBP adopts include Persistent Surveillance; Mobile Surveillance; Cargo Gamma Ray and X-ray Scanners, and Biometric ID technologies. The CBP initially started at exploring the wider capabilities of DLT, and then diverted its attention to working on resolving the global interoperability challenge between various systems. As a result, CBP had recommended to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) two standards on interoperability: Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials that were accepted by W3C as official web standards.30 31 Digital Public Infrastructure Model in Italy: A European Case. The Digital Public Infrastructure model adopted in Italy is a good example of how digital transformation using strategic imperatives results in the availability of impactful nation-scale systems. Italy’s digital transformation is driven by several strategic initiatives and infrastructure investments aimed at modernizing the country’s economy and addressing its current digital gaps32. Italy’s digital transformation push aligns with the European Union’s broader objectives, including the Digital Agenda for Europe and the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF).

The National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR), a key policy initiative, allocates billions towards digital transformation, with a focus on: 1. Digital infrastructure development (e.g., fiber optics, 5G networks, cloud platforms). 2. Industry 5.0 technologies such as AI, IoT, and robotics to modernize manufacturing, logistics, and other sectors (sustainability, ESG) 3. Encouraging small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to adopt digital tools to improve their operations The European Digital Identity (EUDI) Regulation will revolutionize digital identity in the EU by enabling the creation of a universal, trustworthy, and secure European digital identity wallet. A digital identity guarantees all citizens a single authentication method and access to all digital services provided by public administrations and accredited private entities in Italy and Europe. The identification tools used to access online services are the SPID (Public Digital Identity System), the Electronic Identity Card and the National Service Card.33 Italy’s digital infrastructure expansion is essential to enabling new technologies: 1. Fiber optic networks: Italy has been lagging behind other European countries regarding broadband coverage, but it’s now scaling up investments to expand fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) networks, aiming to cover underserved areas and rural communities. Companies like TIM (Telecom Italia) and Open Fiber are leading in this area. 2. 5G networks: Italy has been rolling out 5G infrastructure, which will unlock opportunities for new services, including smart cities, connected vehicles, and advanced IoT applications. 3. Data centers and cloud computing: The Italian government is also investing in national cloud computing infrastructure, including the development of public-sector cloud solutions to support the digitalization of public services. This infrastructure will help Italy manage the growing demand for data processing, storage, and security. 4. Cybersecurity: As digital adoption increases, cybersecurity is a critical area of focus. Investments in secure infrastructure and cybersecurity solutions are being prioritized by both public and private sectors. Incorporating Digital Public Goods (DPGs) alongside Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) is highly relevant to the evolving digital landscape in Italy. Like many countries, Italy is leveraging digital tools and open technologies to foster innovation, improve public services, and support the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). DPGs, which include open-source software, open data, AI models, open standards, and content, are playing a growing role in Italy’s digital transformation. • Italy’s IO app is a prime example of a digital public good. It is an open-source platform that provides citizens with a unified interface to interact with public administration services. It allows access to a variety of public services like digital identity (SPID), digital certificates, and payments (PagoPA), fostering transparency and improving the accessibility of public services. • PagoPA is another key open-source platform that modernizes how citizens interact with public administration for payments. It supports financial inclusion and facilitates transparent, efficient digital payments, which helps in advancing SDG 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions). • SPID (Public Digital Identity System). This is Italy’s national digital identity system, which is interoperable and designed to enable citizens to access public and private services securely.

Italy’s Industry 5.0 plan incentivizes businesses to adopt advanced digital technologies to increase automation, efficiency, and competitiveness. Key opportunities include: 1. Cloud computing: As companies shift to cloud-based solutions, the demand for platforms that offer scalability, flexibility, and security has surged. Italy’s cloud market is growing rapidly, driven by both SMEs and larger enterprises adopting Software as a Service (SaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) solutions. 2. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Big Data: Italian companies and public administrations are increasingly adopting AI for automating processes, enhancing customer service, and making data-driven decisions. AI applications in sectors like healthcare, finance, and manufacturing are also growing. 3. Internet of Things (IoT): Italy is becoming a leader in IoT technologies, especially in the manufacturing sector, where connected devices help optimize production processes, predictive maintenance, and supply chain management. 4. Cybersecurity: The rise in digitalization increases vulnerability to cyber threats. Italy is expanding its investment in cybersecurity frameworks to protect both private and public institutions. Regulations: The initiative to enhance Italy’s public administration systems through investments in a national hybrid cloud infrastructure, referred to as the “Polo Strategico Nazionale” (National Strategic Hub), is a significant step towards modernizing Italy’s digital ecosystem34. The primary aim of the Polo Strategico Nazionale is to ensure that all public administration systems, datasets, and applications are hosted in highly reliable data centers. This includes a focus on: 1. Security: Protecting sensitive government data from cyber threats 2. Performance: Ensuring quick and reliable access to services for citizens and businesses 3. Scalability Allowing for future growth and increased demand for digital services 4. Interoperability: Ensuring that different systems and datasets can work together seamlessly within the European framework 5. Energy Efficiency: Promoting sustainability through efficient energy use in data center operations The investment in the Polo Strategico Nazionale represents a transformative effort to modernize Italy’s public administration through a robust, secure, and efficient cloud infrastructure. By focusing on high standards of quality, security, and interoperability, Italy aims to create a resilient digital framework that will enhance public services and meet the growing demands of its citizens. This initiative not only addresses immediate needs for modernization but also positions Italy to thrive in the increasingly digital future, leveraging data as a strategic asset. The Italian government has taken significant steps to promote Open Data by making public administration data accessible, reusable, and transparent for its citizens. These initiatives align with global trends towards openness and transparency in governance and are aimed at fostering innovation, accountability, and civic participation. • Dati.gov.it is the official national portal for open data in Italy. Launched by the Agency for Digital Italy (AgID), this platform provides centralized access to datasets from various public administrations. It encourages the reuse of public data by developers, researchers, businesses, and citizens to foster innovation and create services that benefit society. 86", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "page_number": 89, "chunk_id": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50_p89_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241202113952-06'00'"}}

It is also important to note that there are other KYC regulations that may be established by regulators located across the UAE (e.g., Abu Dhabi Global Markets, Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority, and a large number of other authorities); however, all these regulations are separate and do not contradict the spirit and approved direction of the aforementioned Federal laws. Drivers for Digital Identity: 1. 1. ICP is the main custodian/driver for adopting Digital ID services specific to affirming persons and organizations legal status in the UAE, and customs and borders protection and security, and has established proper governance, controls and systems for these purposes and is constantly improving those to enable the transition to a highly efficient and effective ecosystem that caters to the needs of the millions living and organizations transacting in the UAE. Moreover, it gauged the interest of many semi-government and private sector entities in adopting Digital ID services to identify and verify persons and organizations. ICP also works with local agencies and departments that are focused on achieving digital enablement, and integration happens between its systems (e.g., UAE Pass) and local government agencies and departments’ web applications. 2. CBUAE is the main custodian/driver for adopting Digital ID services specific to identifying, verifying and affirming persons and organizations financial diligence status (KYC, CDD, EDD, and SDD). It does so by ensuring all banking and financial sector actors comply with federal laws, decisions and regulations. Local regulatory authorities provide their Digital ID services while aligning with the expectations and requirements set forth by federal laws and overseen by the CBUAE. BHUTAN NDI INITIATIVE41 The Kingdom of Bhutan launched a national digital identity42 system in 2023 adopting SSI as a design pattern with which to develop a nation-scale digital trust ecosystem. Adopting the “Digital Trust Ecosystem Building Blocks” model proposed by the Trust Over IP Foundation (ToIP), the Bhutan NDI43 includes trust registries, trust enabling systems, governance and ecosystem parties who participate in the system.

{"text": "It is important to understand that given the wide ranging impact of the NDI project, the stakeholders included the Department of Civil Registration and Census, the Department of Immigration and other agencies. The VCs issued as part of the project cover foundational digital identities and permanent address credentials as well as permits issued for tourism, residency and other purposes. The “trust registries” (NDI Trust Registry and Verifiable Data Registry) are enabled through the inclusion of a vLEI (Verifiable Legal Entity Identifier) issued to trusted parties. With organizations from a cross- section of institutions being involved in the NDI effort, the value is unlocked through the wider acceptance network achieved by including academic institutions, BFSI sector, Telcos and others. At present the set of verifiable data which can be presently issued, exchanged and verified include foundational ID, permanent address credential, academic credential, employment related information, mobile number, driver’s license, vehicle ownership etc. The NDI initiative also enables the creation of self-attested credentials which can be presented during eKYC workflows. REGULATORY APPROACHES IN THE EU EU eIDAS 2.0 Regulation eIDAS 2.0 represents a significant upgrade to the European Union’s electronic Identification, Authentication, and Trust Services (eIDAS) regulation. This enhancement aims to refine and expand cross-border digital identity solutions and trust services, allowing citizens and businesses to securely access a wide range of public and private services across the EU. By enhancing trust services and website authentication, eIDAS 2.0 ensures that transactions across European Union Member States are secure and legally recognized, promoting greater trust, interoperability and reliability in digital interactions. The three pillars of the regulation are the following: 1. eID Schemas. Allows individuals to prove their identity digitally when accessing services. Each EU member state establishes these schemes and can vary in implementation but must comply with eIDAS standards for cross-border recognition. The eIDAS framework defines three levels of assurance for eID schemes: a. Low: Suitable for low-risk transactions, offering basic security. b. Substantial: Provides a higher level of security and is suitable for moderately sensitive transactions. c. High: Offers the highest level of assurance for high-risk or sensitive transactions, such as financial services. 2. EUDI Wallet. A secure, digital identity wallet solution enables citizens and businesses to store and manage their personal information, credentials1, and documents (e.g., ID, driver’s license, banking details) in one place. It allows users to authenticate themselves and access online (trust) services across the EU, including cross-border services, without needing multiple logins or paper documents. 3. Trust Services. The legal framework is built upon acceptance, mutual recognition and equal conditions. Digital services that ensure the security, authenticity, and legal validity of electronic transactions. 93", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "page_number": 96, "chunk_id": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50_p96_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241202113952-06'00'"}}

(PART 5) CONCLUSION As societies globally continue to embrace digital transformation, digital identity systems are poised to play a central role in enabling secure access to services, fostering economic growth, and promoting social inclusion. These systems are evolving beyond mere identity verification to becoming dynamic platforms that integrate with a wide range of public and private services, from financial inclusion and healthcare to cross-border mobility and e-commerce. The trajectory of digital identity systems points toward greater interoperability, decentralization, and personalization, making them a cornerstone of modern digital economies. Emerging trends indicate a growing emphasis on privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) such as zero-knowledge proofs and decentralized identifiers (DIDs). These innovations aim to balance the dual imperatives of data security and user convenience, empowering individuals to control their digital identities while minimizing exposure to privacy risks. Additionally, artificial intelligence and machine learning are expected to refine the efficiency of identity verification processes, ensuring faster and more accurate authentication. The integration of digital identity systems with blockchain technology is a promising development, offering immutable record-keeping and enhanced transparency. Furthermore, the rise of global standardization efforts suggests a future where digital identities can facilitate seamless cross-border interactions, unlocking new possibilities for international trade, migration, and cooperation. However, this bright future comes with significant challenges and risks. One major concern is the potential for digital identity systems to exacerbate existing inequalities. Without equitable access, marginalized populations could face further exclusion from essential services. Similarly, the misuse of personal data, whether through data breaches or unwarranted surveillance, threatens individual privacy and public trust. Biometric data, while secure, raises ethical questions and must be handled with utmost care to avoid misuse. 99", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "page_number": 102, "chunk_id": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50_p102_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241202113952-06'00'"}}

GSMI 5.0 SUPPLY CHAIN – EXECUTIVE SUMMARY We believe that the future of global supply chains must depend on machine-verifiable (paperless) proofs to ensure the authenticity, legality, and origin of shipments. Achieving this vision requires standards that serve everyone—individuals, organizations, and nations—regardless of their size. The purpose of this document is to evaluate the current landscape of global supply chain standards, assess our progress, and chart a path forward. In our research, we identified over four hundred major standards organizations worldwide, collectively responsible for more than 60,000 published standards. While the volume of standards is not an issue, the challenge lies in understanding how they relate to each other, and determining which standards provide the best pathways toward inclusive and frictionless global supply chains. A key initial contribution of this document is the distillation of over nine hundred data elements related to global shipments, drawn from the broad landscape of existing supply chain standards, into forty-eight fundamental data elements that capture the essential movement information. This simplification marks an important first step in harmonizing the data elements across standards. While key to pointing out the need for harmonization, it also became apparent that any such review of tens of thousands of standards in an attempt to harmonize would fail. However, by pulling back out to the space level, our analysis focused on seventeen standards bodies that meet the World Trade Organization’s (WTO) six criteria for global standards entities: transparency, openness, impartiality and consensus, effectiveness and relevance, coherence, and inclusion of developing countries. We evaluated these organizations based on their mission, industry focus, membership, number of published standards, and funding model. Our recommendation is to concentrate efforts on the ten standards organizations that provide open standards for digital documents, at no cost. Data elements must be digital, so we also envision how digital identity, digital twins, sensors, blockchains and artificial intelligence can technically enable trusted and paperless global supply chains BRIEF REVIEW OF GSMI 4.0 – SUPPLY CHAIN (2023) To start, we used a simplified supply chain use case, where an everyday individual – let’s call her Maria – ordered a gift online and, because it delivered late, had to figure out how to return it. With this initial Supply Chain effort, we started with an intentionally simplistic and normal example of something most people can do: ‘Maria ordered a birthday present online.’ Unfortunately, the problem was that item arrived after the birthday party and Maria was thrown into the deep end of the global supply chain pool as she had to navigate trying to return it. What started as a simple example of a routine online purchase unfortunately turned into a late delivery, a 102", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "page_number": 105, "chunk_id": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50_p105_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241202113952-06'00'"}}

What most people don’t see in their everyday purchases is that when an item is initially purchased, there can be close to 50 steps to get that item from the website, across a border, to the point of delivery, and, as it turned out in our example, the reverse of that to get the item returned. The working group then worked through the various modes of transportation, types of commerce, parties involved, data exchange, documentation, and, finally, the critical nature of the proxies of trust that have been used in these processes since trade began thousands of years ago. Hundreds of data elements were identified involving the movement of goods, which were distilled down to about four dozen data elements most frequently used for global movement of goods, like shipper, receiver, broker, etc. Then, where possible, those items were mapped to their corresponding standards quickly pointing out that the standards could come from many different entities, and, in some cases, an entity pointed to another standards entity, making clear the case for harmonized standards in global commerce. In this context, the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) Digital Standards Initiative (DSI) has released Key Trade Documents and Data Elements (KTDDE), having published a parallel effort designated as the Minimum Data Elements.

{"text": "“While thousands of years of trade have led us to the global supply chain of today, blockchain and emerging technologies are leading us to a future where paperless trade can become a reality, transforming industry and regulatory processes, and entire industries. That is why GBBC’s BITA initiative has come to fruition, bringing together major global logistics and transportation stakeholders to thoughtful adoption of Web3 innovations toward a new generation of global commerce that can finally adopt an “International Space Station” view. BITA is working as a global harmonizer for open data standards in global commerce.” INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION VIEW ON STANDARDS In the process from buying to shipping to payment for any item, there are vast amounts of documentation exchanged. Standards are meant to facilitate global commerce through harmonization of processes. There are over four hundred major standards organizations worldwide, when combining international (about 10-20), regional ( about10-15), national ( about 160 – many are National Representative bodies of International Groups), and industry specific (several hundred). Just from the international standards entities, we have approximately 60,000 published standards. It is important to note, we are not lacking for published standards. We are lacking in harmonized, interoperable, and open standards with a truly global, particularly a global commerce, focus. We are also lacking in the language, or data-organization that can harmonize standards. We will later discuss the definition of a standard, and the six principles set by the World Trade Organization (WTO), as requirements for global standards entities. Out of the vast landscape of standards bodies, the working group identified that there are currently less than twenty standards organizations that rise to that WTO level, meaning that they can be considered to meet the six principles for global standards. These are the entities we will review and compare in later sections. Those entities represent more than 150 years of ‘standards’ development, during which the world has continually evolved, including massive changes in technology. One thing immediately clear is that each of those entities has done excellent work, and they were each created for a specific reason, staffed by committed leaders in the industry. When it comes to global harmonization, there historically has been little focus on overlaps at that International Space Station level. The goal at hand is to align silos of the standards world in support of open, interoperable, and harmonized global standards for international commerce. With this review, it is also becoming clear that there are a couple of splits taking place in the international standards arena: • There is a division between ‘legacy,’ (paper/document) vs. ‘digital’ (post-document), e.g., for global commerce, the ‘legacy’ could be thought of as the rear-view mirror, and the ‘digital’ could be considered the windshield. • There is also a division between fee-based standards entities and those entities which have opened their standards for use by all. As we explore the need for harmonization, it leads us to the critical importance of ‘open’ (non-fee-based) standards. For true harmonization, interoperability, integration, speed, and reduced friction in global commerce, what will scale globally is open standards. 110", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "page_number": 113, "chunk_id": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50_p113_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241202113952-06'00'"}}
{"text": "Once we get to ‘open,’ this really becomes a discussion about ‘digital,’ which is to say, a post- document (paperless) global supply chain. Many systems today utilize AI-enabled Optical Character Recognition (OCR) solutions to digitize documents and data entries While helpful to automate, simply translating a data element from a paper document into a digital format might be a step in the right direction, it doesn’t connect directly to the source of that data. When data elements from existing documents can be identified down to the source, we will evolve beyond the dozens and hundreds of movement documents we have used for millennia as proxies for trust, and then we can rethink (digitalize) the processes. Once we digitize, we also get to things like digital identity, blockchain, sensors, AI and other existing and yet-to-be-developed critical emerging technologies that will transform global supply chains in the future. Open is also achieved by a decentralized, shared environment of digital data called blockchain. Standards are an important piece of streamlining global commerce; however, there are other key components that have brought us to this point and will take us forward. Standards propel a ‘network effect’ which is also a key part of this discussion. Network effects have been seen before in many ways, from the earliest days of trade to the Industrial Revolution, to Globalization in the 20th Century, to now the Digital Revolution and beyond. The role we all play in embracing the global nature of what got us here, and the key impact of technology moving forward, is critical. From the space viewstandards, technology, and emerging governance models, along with existing government and regulatory components, must work for all parties, public and private, large, and small, and they must be both open and interoperable. HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE: WHAT IS A ‘STANDARD’? Standards have been around since the Egyptians (~3000 BCE), they exist in every aspect of our society and is it inevitable that we must work together on open, harmonized, and interoperable standards for global commerce to continue to scale with emerging digital technologies. The discussion of ‘Standards’ is the first specific reference of ‘network effect,’ but we will revisit it in other areas of this work. Just to put a definition out there for context for this effort, standards are a formalized set of guidelines, technical specifications, or established criteria designed to ensure consistency, safety, quality, and interoperability across a given activity, product, or process. One of the earliest standards was in Egypt thousands of years ago and was the length of the forearm from elbow to the tip of the middle finger, called a ‘cubit,’ and it helped to standardize construction of the pyramids and other things in ancient Egypt. As society and technology developed, we then saw standardization of commercial transactions, weights, and measures in Babylon (~1750 BCE), road construction in Rome (~500 BCE), quality standards by guilds in Europe (12th century), and the metric system in 1799. By the mid 1800’s, we saw standards for railroad track width, and the early 1900’s brought us airline and automotive industries and standards, and now we chronologically overlap with the current International Standards Development Organizations (ISDO). Of the group of ISDO’s we will review, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) was established in 1865, and then we see the Universal Postal Union (UPU) in 1874, and, over the next century or so, the others in our review were established including the International Standards Organization (ISO) in 1947, all the way to UN/CEFACT in 1996. Multiple entities like these were established during and after WWII (ICAO-1944, IATA-1945, ISO-1947, IMO-1948, WCO-1952). 111", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "page_number": 114, "chunk_id": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50_p114_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241202113952-06'00'"}}

The network effect is such that each additional user makes the network more valuable to all existing users, and the associated reduction in friction leads to the inevitability of open and interoperable standards for the global supply chain on the horizon. STANDARDS LANDSCAPE TODAY The international standards community has spent a great deal of time mapping the various standards globally, as well as effective governance models to coordinate standards bodies. Below is a standards map referred to as ‘The Onion,’ produced and developed through collaboration in the DFM Data Corp Transport Unit Identifier (TUID) Working Group. This shows the various layers of standards entities and gives us a visual sense of these entities along with our International Space Station analogy. We will be focusing on the international standards entities in the third layer from the top (Standards Organizations/Standards Bodies) and those entities just above that line. • Like a view from the ISS, this graphic starts at the global organizations level with ITFA, EU, G7, G20, WTO, UN, and NATO, which leads us to trade, transportation, technology, and finance entities. • We then get down to our current focus area of International Standards Development Organizations, such as IEEE, ISO, etc. • Next is Emerging Technology Standards, and then we get to additional layers around US Rule makers & Government Agencies, Maritime Laws, US Industry Associations, and Non-SDO Standard Developers in the US. 112", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "page_number": 115, "chunk_id": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50_p115_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241202113952-06'00'"}}
{"text": "Even with this graphic doing its best to categorize these key entities, it is still apparent that each of these entities was created separately, over the last 150 years, all with acronyms we may or may not be familiar with, and this is an incredibly fragmented discussion around standards. Each of these entities tried to make sense (through standards) of an industry or country or type of movement (Customs, etc.), or other segments. They are all excellent examples of ‘Best in Class’ over the last 150 years, but at the ISS level, we see dozens of these across industry and geography with little to no common focus around open and interoperable global movement, such as what we currently see in e-Commerce (B2C, Business-to-Consumer) examples. We saw this extremely fragmented view at its worst during the Covid pandemic where a product wasn’t on the shelf, or ships were stuck at a port, etc., which exaggerated the already elevated levels of friction (documents, resources, delays) to move products across borders. What we need is a global commerce focus on standards, and not just any one industry or segment, and it must embrace harmonized, interoperable, and open digital standards. Some international standards entities created after WWII are a snapshot of what supply chains looked like 75 years ago, prior to the ‘digital’ discussion, or even the internet. KEY INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATIONS The six WTO/TBT (Technical Barriers to Trade) principles required for global standards entities, which encompass what a standard should convey, are the following: 1. Transparency: All essential information regarding current work programs, as well as proposals for standards, guides, and recommendations under consideration and progress reports on the work programs, should be accessible to all interested parties. 2. Openness: Membership of an international standardizing body should be open on a non- discriminatory basis to relevant bodies of at least all WTO members. 3. Impartiality & Consensus: All relevant bodies should be provided with meaningful opportunities to contribute to the development of international standards, guides, and recommendations. The procedures should not give privilege to, or favor the interests of, any particular supplier, country, or region. 4. Effectiveness & Relevance: International standards need to be relevant and effectively respond to regulatory and market needs, as well as scientific and technological developments. 5. Coherence: In order to avoid the development of conflicting international standards, it is important that international standardizing bodies avoid duplication or, or overlap with, the work of other international standardizing bodies. 6. Development Dimension: Constraints on developing countries’ effective participation in standards development should be addressed. The development dimension should be taken into consideration in the development of international standards. Using these principles as a reference in addition to the Onion graphic above, a deeper dive into the key International Standards Development Organizations relevant for global supply listed is illustrated below. These organizations are listed in chronological order of when they were established. 113", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "page_number": 116, "chunk_id": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50_p116_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241202113952-06'00'"}}

With the goal of identifying common concepts across standards, the working group assessed the purpose of these standards in terms of what they are meant to accomplish, along with the portion of “movement” covered by them, based on the common data elements identified for all physical shipments (e.g., import/export, customs, sellers/buyers, point of origination, point of destination, etc.), industry focus, and level of adoption as defined by global presence and number of standards. Importantly, these standards entities were analyzed based on whether they offer freely available or open-source standards, as opposed to a more traditional model of selling access to standards for a fee. This led to an assessment of alternative revenue models for those entities that make their standards freely available. Standards setting entities were also categorized for being traditional document-based or digital-first.

{"text": "There are two recent items of note where we are starting to see some early alignment between more than one of these entities. In July 2024, UNECE (the parent organization of UN/CEFACT) and the ICC Digital Standards Initiative (DSI) called on the industry to accelerate the adoption of globally interoperable standards essential for achieving digital trade worldwide. In August 2024, ISO, IEC and ITU announced the coordination of publishing a monthly document that lists all work items from the three organizations including updates on the projects and timelines from the technical committees’ work (link).With the major global standards entities discussed above, which set the basis for harmonization from their large scope and global adoption, there has also developed a hierarchy in the standards setting world. Generally, standards setting bodies that cover a broader range of data elements across the journey of movement from origin to destination, set a point of reference for other smaller and more narrowly focused standards setting initiatives. In a traditional model where standards are made available for purchase, those organizations that purchase standards are expected to commit to following those standards. In addition, auditors and certifiers who validate other organizations’ compliance with standards must also purchase these same standards. On the other hand, models that offer open-source standards may be more dynamic, providing tools for end users to configure data elements based on their own needs (e.g., different shipment types). Open-source standards may also increase users’ ease of adopting standards across the supply chain: • Sellers may assign common data elements to product at the point of export, which customs authorities may refer to at the point of entry • Initial sellers’ compliance with a standard facilitates compliance at the level of resellers, labeling companies, and larger marketplaces • Open-source standards may also facilitate auditing and verification processes to ensure compliance with the standard, reducing the risk of manipulation of information or erroneous classification • Global standards that are openly available will facilitate compliance across complex supply chains.1 When standards are made freely available, revenue models may also shift toward charging for additional documentation or services, different forms of membership fees, or public funding. This points to the shifting trend in standards models introduced above, which is taking place and will be essential for harmonizing and scaling tech-based solutions for global supply chains. This trend favors open-source rather than fee-based standards models, with digital-first (post-document) rather than paper-based models. HARMONIZATION/INTEROPERABILITY The initial models of standards as we know them started in Egypt, and in the thousands of years since then, standards have dramatically expanded in many ways, to include geography, industry, and technology. Yet, for the most part, once a standards entity exists it stays in its lane, so if the focus is customs, or aviation, etc., that tends to remain the focus. This has worked extremely well to map out and develop key standards in many fields as outlined in the entities we reviewed, but it doesn’t account for the world of today from the International Space Station viewpoint. That is why we started this GSMI 5.0 Supply Chain effort with a view from space as our default position. Rather than building each entity out one step and one standard at a time (essentially, process improvement), looking at the global view makes it apparent that all of this will have to come together (breakthrough 118", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "page_number": 121, "chunk_id": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50_p121_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241202113952-06'00'"}}
{"text": "thinking) to truly lean into the digital world that exists today and tomorrow, and that leads us to harmonization and interoperability. The sooner we align on the inevitability of this global view, and what that means for harmonization and interoperability, the sooner we can all work together to accelerate into that space for the benefit of a much more streamlined global supply chain. Currently, much of the world moves at the physical speed of items, be that by water, rail, road, air, or a combination of those (multi-modal), including the paper documents we use as proxies for trust like Commercial Invoice, Bills of Lading, etc. However, critical emerging technologies promise a future where the key trusted elements from those documents we have used for millennia will move digitally and at the speed of data, and well ahead of the physical items they represent. One example would be that customs agencies and others in the supply chain could access secure data from trusted sources (verifiable credentials, etc.) to analyze and optimize that data, and, under some set of circumstances, could significantly reduce or even eliminate the traditional ‘port of entry’ concept, since these are known items from trusted sources. That single example helps envision the transformative nature of this technology to completely rethink global supply chains. To accomplish that, we must bring the standards entities together at that ISS level view, so we accelerate harmonization of standards and interoperability of processes. That means aligning different standards to ensure they are compatible and can work together globally, which is essential in a world where businesses and supply chains routinely operate across borders. Where we can reduce friction across borders, we all win, and global commerce can significantly speed up. Interoperability is the goal here, where different systems, products, or services can exchange and use information seamlessly. Harmonization ensures that various local or industry-specific standards don’t become isolated silos but are a part of a larger, integrated global system. Harmonized, interoperable standards create smoother, more scalable global systems and reduce compliance costs for businesses, accelerating participation in global trade. INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION AND REGULATORY PROGRESS Regulatory developments today are also favoring progress toward global harmonization of standards for digital trade. Legislation may be needed to ensure support of standards, with adequate educational resources and frameworks in place to facilitate adoption. For example, the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), which operates as a subsidiary of the UN General Assembly, has adopted a Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records (MLETR), which introduces a legal framework to allow electronic documentation to be adopted instead of paper-based documentation. Legislation related to logistics at a national level, in turn, must align with MLETR as an international framework. The aim of MLETR is to facilitate paperless trade, through a legal environment that supports the recognition of electronic documentation as legally valid when functionally equivalent to the paper-based version of such documentation. The aim is to facilitate and expand the adoption of electronic documents at a domestic and international level.

The international community will benefit from continued efforts to advance harmonization and interoperability, including: • Calls to action for global adoption of unified standards for digital trade • Open-source repositories of key trade documents, data elements, and reference data models for global transportation • Development and maintenance of a business standard that can be applied at a national and regional level across administrations and industries • Open-source data sets to be used for global regulatory developments supporting digital trade • Legislation may be needed to ensure support of standards, with adequate educational resources and frameworks in place to facilitate adoption OPEN STANDARDS Harmonized and interoperable global data standards are necessary, are a huge step forward, and are both a grand aspirational goal and a necessity. However, back to our view from space, harmonized and interoperable data standards are just one step in the inevitable journey to create and optimize the global economy and global supply chains of the 21st century, and beyond. The next step for scale is the need for open data standards. Traditional standards models were built around B2B (Business-to-Business), with a cost of entry for memberships, access, contributions to standards development, etc. At that time, there was little effort to focus on what is now known as e-Commerce (B2C), which generally refers to the online sale and shipment of items of minimal value, and which is currently a revenue engine in many economies. Even some Customs agencies currently have lesser requirements for that low-value (di minimis, for example, <$800 USD) product to be imported, though that is starting to change. While all the entities reviewed are government agencies or ‘Not-for-Profit,’ all do have a revenue model. All seventeen entities generate their revenue in multiple ways, including charging for the use of their standards, membership fees, consulting services, sales of publications, training, etc., and UN agencies are funded by member states. However, those with open standards (10 of 17) do not charge for the use of their standards and gain their revenue in other ways. While, viewed through multiple centuries of evolution, the current international standards entities each helped us get to where we are today, current and future types of commerce (B2B, C2C – Consumer-to-Consumer, aka, Peer-to-Peer, etc.) and digital and decentralized technology drive the inevitability of international movement standards needing to be open. The result will reduce friction and cost across borders, and will function as an accelerator for global commerce, to include the speed of movement. The earlier customs example where, based on trusted data moving ahead of the physical movement and approved to cross a border and resulting in no port of entry is a good indication of the difference between current processes compared to what will be much quicker global movement across borders. Current ‘fee-based’ standards function as ‘toll gates’ for global commerce activity, and while they have helped us get to where we are today, charging for standards won’t help us realize the ‘breakthrough thinking’ moving forward of truly optimized movement at the global level. 120", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "page_number": 123, "chunk_id": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50_p123_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241202113952-06'00'"}}
{"text": "The shift to B2C, C2C, etc., puts those membership models at risk. Where previously paying for a standard could be considered ‘the cost of doing business’ for large entities, increasingly, not only with the shift to B2C/C2C but also with technology advances allowing for decentralized, trusted, and more inclusive models, legacy standards entities may face the choice between becoming obsolete or transitioning to an open model for their standards to stay relevant. Charging a large entity for the use of standards may have worked for a period, but a current or future small start-up or lone entrepreneur is unlikely to be able to afford that, effectively suppressing growth globally in that type of small business. The vast majority of global businesses and employers are small and medium enterprises, and standards are essential to access global markets and increase competitiveness. Of note, IATA (est. 1945) and WCO (est. 1952) have each opened their standards recently, both of which used to be fee based, so precedence has been set. Open standards are a key accelerant in this process. They democratize access to global trade and digital ecosystems, allowing small, medium, and large enterprises to participate without artificial barriers. THIS IS REALLY A ‘DIGITAL’ DISCUSSION Digitization of Data Elements for Movement Now that we have harmonized, interoperable and open data standards for global movement, we finally get to the key point, which is digitizing key data elements for traditional movement documents and other key processes. This is literally -the- moment in human history where, since the start of what we originally called ‘trade’ (~3,000 BCE), physical items (clay tablets, papyrus, parchment, and, finally, paper) have been used as proxies for trust, moving forward the future of the global supply chain is digital. Yes, of course, there will still be physical movement, but by creating trusted and secure digital data elements surrounding that movement, we now move into a paperless (post- document) global supply chain. The ability for those key data elements about a shipment to move ahead of the physical shipment and at the speed of data will transform everything we know of global movement in all modes (water, rail, road, air, multi-modal). Once those data elements are digitized, we can and will completely rethink (digitalize) those processes, reinventing many aspects of how global supply chains operate. When we now think of a ‘digital’ global supply chain, it creates a portal into multiple current and emerging technologies that will be equally transformative in this space, including digital identity, blockchain, sensors, AI, etc. Digital Twins An example of the value of digitization is a ‘digital twin,’ which is a virtual representation of an object or system designed to reflect a physical object accurately. For example, it can represent a physical package and track its trajectory, providing real-time data on the status of any given shipment. It also spans the object’s lifecycle, is updated from real-time data, and uses simulation, machine learning and reasoning to help make decisions. By digitizing that data, all aspects of that physical item can be broken into distinct processes, from manufacture to movement, to sale, to resale, and so forth, and can therefore be tracked and managed accordingly, potentially into micro data and/or revenue streams. The signed feature of blockchain capabilities, through verification, adds trust to the process. Digital twins of real-world assets are signed and verified, preserving the attributes of what makes each 121", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "page_number": 124, "chunk_id": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50_p124_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241202113952-06'00'"}}
{"text": "digital twin unique, while providing digital connectivity to an inherently physical process of global movement of an item. Digital Identity As we digitize key data elements in a trusted and secure manner, one of the initial next steps will be what some consider the next ‘Holy Grail,’ which is digital identity. ‘I am who I say I am,’ sounds straightforward, but when hundreds of millions of shipments are moving globally every day, determining data points such as who created the product, from which part of the world it was created, whether forced labor was involved (forced labor=yes/no), who sold the product, who bought the product, and other key areas, can be challenging without digital solutions. It is a huge opportunity for data points tied to these processes digitally, as they are generally currently done using documents. Once digitized, current and emerging technologies can analyze and optimize that data to enhance informed decision making, such as creating predictive models (What will happen?) and prescriptive models (How can we make that happen?). Now we get to the Customs example where those dots can be connected and, because of the hundreds or thousands of previous shipments from the shipper, that entity can be both known and trusted, or not trusted if unknown. The same goes for recurring movement to the receiver, and the dots can connect, with global scalability. Customs agencies, including U.S. Customs, are accelerating into this space, and they are also working across borders with their peers, the goal of which will be to create a true ‘single (clearance) window’ for movement, starting with verifiable credentials. Critical to all of this work will be that definitions such that ‘identity’ (and other examples in this paper – blockchain, etc.) are defined the same way by all standards entities, and not only in the eye of the beholder, or based on decades of work based on previous generations of technology. Key terms in this space are ‘DID’ (Decentralized Identifier), which represents an entity (person, shipment, product) and ‘VC’ (Verifiable Credential), containing information or claims that can be cryptographically verified. A DID identifies who/what something is, while a VC states what we know about it. The next iteration of the ACE (Automated Commercial Environment) platform for U.S. Customs (ACE 2.0) is in development, and will be credentialed, so this is coming much sooner than later. Back to the importance of open standards in support of B2C/C2C commerce, in regions where traditional identity is lacking, digital identities provide a means for micro-entrepreneurs to enter the formal economy, participate in global supply chains, and access financial services. By providing a verifiable credential (identity), even small entities can engage in cross-border commerce with large corporations, reducing barriers to entry. Globally, that will lead to authentication, trust, scalability, cross-border compatibility, unified systems, inclusion, fraud prevention, and smart contracts using blockchain. As digital identities evolve, the concept of self-sovereign identity, where individuals or organizations have full control over their digital identity without relying on a central authority, is gaining traction, which could further enhance trust and autonomy in global supply chains. In this context, many global entities have substantial data that can be used to identify and validate companies and individuals operating across global supply chains, ensuring that a given entity is in fact a trusted shipper, etc. With established common standards, there can be multiple ways to identify these users and certify them as trusted entities. With better solutions on common identifiers, traceability can be improved as well as trust. For example, the Global Legal Entity 122", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "page_number": 125, "chunk_id": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50_p125_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241202113952-06'00'"}}
{"text": "Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) has established a Legal Entity Identifier (LEI), ), recognized as ISO 17442 standard, which has been accepted as a trusted and viable commercial option in many aspects of the global supply chain, such as supporting an e-bill of lading model. This standard defines the basic reference data or a set of attributes that serve as the most essential components of identification for legal entities in financial transactions. Blockchain, Sensors, and AI The concept of blockchain has been envisioned for years, and many have just wanted to immediately jump into that space as a revenue model. But rather than a single company simply using blockchain, we go back to the ISS view from space, which is, for blockchain to scale it will take a pro-competitive global village, a ‘coopetition,’ where increasing opportunities for all stakeholders become an incentive even for traditional competitors to engage more securely in collaborative ways. Agreement to adopt common data language, driven by a semantic ontology, as well as adoption of standards, interoperability, and harmonization, are examples of such collaborative behaviors. Scaling this globally is pro-consumer. We will all have to play in that space, and no single company will be able to put a logo on it for their exclusive use. Now that we are at the ‘digital’ discussion for global commerce, blockchain, even if not yet fully mature, is both a feasible, and inevitable outcome, but foundationally it will take this truly global approach. Where authenticity (provenance, pedigree) matters, blockchain and Web3 will be transformative. ‘What is the true source of that data, or that product,’ and ‘can that be proven’ become significant changes for global supply chains using current and emerging technologies, with data recorded immutably on a ledger of verified records. Those entities, to include Customs agencies, can then use AI and other analytics and optimization tools to significantly streamline their operations, reducing friction across borders (documents, resources, delays), and speeding up global supply chains. Essentially, data recorded and shared over blockchain-based ledgers can be validated as trusted inputs going into AI algorithms to draw patterns and support better informed decision making. Finally, sensors/IoT devices are very complementary to this entire discussion since sensors can capture the physical world and digitize the results (location, temperature, humidity, shock, light, etc.). Where desired, data from a uniquely identified sensor could be memorialized onto a blockchain for security and for immutable retention. Where certainty matters, at the highest levels, such as chemotherapy medicines and other similar healthcare scenarios, the combination of blockchain and sensors, with that data analyzed and optimized by AI, provides all stakeholders a clear sense of the future of global supply chains. As blockchain is becoming increasingly scalable and due to technological advances (e.g., interoperability mechanisms, sharding, side-chains, etc.), it is now feasible to use near real-time IoT sensor data for the majority of supply chain ecosystems. It is important to define what IoT data logs may not need to be kept on chain, to optimize business value for space utilized, while keeping real-time IoT sensor readings accessible on chain. CREATING A NETWORK EFFECT Standards are an important piece of streamlining global commerce, however, there are other key components and areas that have brought us to this point and will take us forward into a truly digital global supply chain. This is a network effect discussion, where the value or utility of a product, service, or system (in this case, global commerce) increases as more people adopt it. Historically, each era added network effect inertia and an expanding focus on greater geography, to the ISS view we have today: 123", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "page_number": 126, "chunk_id": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50_p126_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241202113952-06'00'"}}

The sooner we focus on the global level, the sooner we accelerate adoption of those harmonized, interoperable, and open data standards, increasing value for all. This network effect not only accelerates the growth of global supply chains but also facilitates the continued expansion of international trade. As more entities digitize and rethink (digitalize) their processes, to include digital identity, blockchain, AI, etc., the overall value of the global supply chain network increases, leading to faster, more efficient, and more resilient trade. Encouraging the participation of all stakeholders, beyond suppliers and tier-1 stages of the supply chain, will create a network effect that can be a gamechanger in terms of visibility, traceability, and trust. A PRACTICAL LOOK AT THE RESULTS OF HARMONIZED, OPEN STANDARDS AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGY When data standards are harmonized, they allow for frameworks to be developed that define a business problem and show how this data and these technologies can be used to solve it. Standardized data allows for more efficient exchange of information and comparability between data from different parties. Tokenization Tokenization is the result of breaking down such an item into its digital representation, through the creation of one or more unique ‘tokens,’ representing digital value. The token uses a non-human readable format, the data is cryptographically secure, is stored in a cloud data vault, and can only be decrypted with the appropriate key (e.g., rules). The tokenization process is highly customizable by those issuing or transacting with the tokens, including whether sensitive business information is included. So, based on the preference of asset owners and token issuers, a token representing a shipment of penicillin may have the property of the drug shipment, but would not have the cost or the name of the end purchaser, and smart contracts can enforce specific rules around data access. Other considerations for tokens may be whether this is a private or public blockchain, or data access and privacy considerations (e.g., restricting data only to crucial stakeholders and not to all sub- contractors along the supply chain). Frameworks Work is underway to create blueprints of supply chain use cases through the lens of tokenization and blockchain projects, and some entities are using these blueprints to build frameworks for use case implementation.

Focus areas include supply chain, carbon emissions tracking and tracing, and voluntary ecological markets and carbon credits. The IWA maintains the Token Taxonomy Framework (TTF), the purpose of which is to clearly define innovative technology concepts and terms in the context of new tokenization use cases/scenarios. TTF provides definitions that have clear and well-understood requirements for properties and behaviors that are implementation-neutral for developers to follow and standards organizations to validate against. The taxonomy from TTF serves as underlying foundational data structure for reporting and disclosures. The framework establishes a base Token Classification Hierarchy, driven by metadata, which is simple to understand and use, and which enables the generation of visual representations of classifications and modeling tools to view and create token definitions mapped to the taxonomy. A Blockchain Supply Chain Use Case In this harmonized, interoperable, open, and digitized supply chain that is on the near horizon, foundational use cases for movement are already being created. In the following example, BITA is contemplating the following challenge using a ‘crawl, walk, run’ methodology for a blockchain solution, e.g., ‘crawl’ would be the initial technical effort to prove out the concept. ‘Walk’ adds features, and ‘run’ would be full use of the technology and use case.

As this develops, other use case frameworks will be created that will move the ‘paperless supply chain’ vision forward, paving the way toward a blockchain-based supply chain as traditional signing of physical “paper” documents transitions toward digital verifications, with real-world implementations that will benefit all stakeholders. THE GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN OF 2035 AND BEYOND To create a speculative outlook on what future supply chains might look like using current trajectories we need to consider multiple factors, including, history, network effects, current and emerging technologies, and economic, environmental, and social trends. This is a ‘breakthrough thinking’ exercise, which gets us to a point on the horizon (let’s call it our ‘True North’), rather than the outcome ‘process improvement’ would provide, based only on previous and current small iterative steps. We start with the ISS view which, by then, includes harmonized, interoperable, open, and digital standards, and interoperable digital ecosystems will result in trusted data flowing freely across borders and industries. When, in combination with sensors (as applicable), we know where everything is, we won’t need as much, which will impact inventories. And, in combination with 3D printing/additive manufacturing and predictive analytics around procurement, not only will we more efficiently fulfill orders, but those products will also be closer than ever to the receiver, reducing shipping times, in addition to the global efficiencies previously discussed for international movement. Smart contracts, potentially with the use of AI agents, will securely automate transactions and ensure compliance with global standards instantly.

Every transaction, from production to delivery, will be securely recorded, enabling real-time verification of every step in the supply chain. AI will drive decision-making across the supply chain, optimizing everything from procurement to logistics in real-time, and advancements in robotics and autonomous vehicles can further maximize efficiencies. Unlike what we experienced during the Covid pandemic; predictive analytics will anticipate disruptions before they occur. Every participant and product in the supply chain will have a unique identity, which will ensure authenticity, reduce counterfeiting, and enhance consumer trust. Supply chains will also be designed to minimize environmental impact, with many operations achieving carbon-neutral (or even carbon- negative) status. We are already starting to see Digital Product Passports (DPP) that will track an item from cradle to grave and create a circular economy. Renewable energy, sustainable materials, and zero-waste processes will be standard. Also, the ethical treatment of workers and the responsible sourcing of materials will be non-negotiable. All of this will lead to consumers, empowered by transparency, demanding higher standards of ethics and sustainability, and companies will comply, or risk being excluded from the market. To no surprise by now, regulations will be globally harmonized, interoperable, and open, to facilitate seamless international trade. Also, robotics, drones and automation will each play a key role globally. In summary, the global supply chain of ten years from now t and beyond will be a highly integrated, intelligent, and adaptive system. It will balance efficiency with sustainability and, with the digital foundation built in the coming years, will utilize advanced technologies like AI, blockchain and further emerging technologies to create a seamless flow of goods and services across the globe. Driven by network effects, these supply chains will be more resilient, ethical, and responsive to the needs of both consumers and the environment.

CONCLUSION & CALL TO ACTION: A UNIFIED VISION FOR GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN STANDARDS As we stand at the threshold of a new era in global commerce, the challenges, and opportunities before us are immense. From the vantage point of the International Space Station, Earth appears as a singular, interconnected system, underscoring the need for unity and collaboration in shaping the future of our global supply chains. The transition from fragmented, localized or industry-level standards to a future of harmonized, interoperable, and open systems is not just an economic imperative but a call to action for international standards entities and stakeholders worldwide. For over a century, current day standards organizations have been foundational in facilitating trade and innovation. However, in the digital-first era, the traditional, siloed approaches must give way to a new paradigm of global collaboration, a pro-competitive ‘coopetition’ approach. No single entity can address the complexities of the evolving supply chain alone. We must break free from sector-specific approaches and work together to create open, digital definitions and standards that transcend industries and borders, fostering interoperability (e.g., between blockchain-based systems and existing systems used to manage data and processes along global supply chains) and supporting the digital identity of goods and services.

Standards provide resilience for projects, ultimately ensuring innovations are deployed in a responsible and truly impactful manner as they are intended. This report addresses those activities at the intersection of blockchain technology and sustainability goals. It starts with covering a basic taxonomy of authority bodies and basic applicable rules, followed by a discussion of ways blockchain can advance sustainability projects, and finally a discussion on how the blockchain space itself is taking measures to operate in a sustainable manner.

Entities operating at the intersection of blockchain technology and sustainability are bound to navigate the complex and evolving landscape of regulatory requirements for blockchain technology, and in addition, be compliant with requirements covering their sustainability practices. It is important to consider the landscape of global authorities setting standards, best practices, and regulatory obligations, in addition to the data and requirements around reporting and disclosures. Public-private partnerships can be fundamental to guiding and establishing reasonable and measured obligations, especially at a global level. There is still a need to address and harmonize fragmented systems and approaches. Below is a taxonomy of sources of legal, regulatory and quasi-legal authority related to climate and sustainability.

II. BLOCKCHAIN TO ADVANCE SUSTAINABILITY GOALS Emerging technologies including blockchain can greatly help address climate change concerns and facilitate compliance with increasing sustainability requirements. Blockchain provides a toolset to solve business problems in ways that are in compliance with regulations and environmentally friendly best practices. These solutions are increasingly relevant as nation-states are taking steps to comply with the Paris Agreement commitments and turning to technology to assist them to tackle the most complex and urgent issues of taking climate action, ensuring transition plans, and reducing emissions. Moreover, the ability to implement these technology tools depends on legal, regulatory, and voluntary standard landscapes where companies and organizations are operating. The legal context could bring challenges that blockchain technology can help overcome, becoming a tool to support competitive advantages by facilitating compliance with requirements. Reporting, which has largely focused on carbon emissions, can be difficult to accurately calculate across direct Scope 1 to indirect Scope 3 emissions, and subsequently report to the public. Emerging technologies including blockchain can help with this task, in the context of standardized reporting mechanisms still in development.

Earth’s biggest systems that trap carbon (forests/rainforests/soil) are no longer trapping as much as necessary. Risks to humans range from health, natural disasters and extreme weather, and impacts on infrastructure. Permacultures, for instance, introduce an ethical and holistic, ethical approach to land management and settlement that draws on natural ecosystem dynamics that are inherently localized. The goal is to improve sustainability practices and reduce waste, while increasing efficiency and transparency of supply chains, and verifying that resources are adequately sourced, managed, and recycled or repurposed. Blockchain technology can track data to ensure effective mitigation practices, with an unprecedented level of transparency to monitor short- and long-term impacts. NFTs and incentive structures that affect bottom lines can further advance a range of best practices to combat climate change and its effects. Ultimately, blockchain technology can record data, impact, and align incentives toward responsible use of resources at a local level, even as granular as micro communities or individuals. Sustainable Housing: There is opportunity to utilize localized resources to build multi-family units, such as wood from trees that get replanted with sustainable considerations. Blockchain technology can ensure the provenance of materials, ensuring responsible sourcing, ecosystem conservation practices, and guaranteeing that there is no deforestation impact. Food Supply: Localized, and even hyper-localized resources can support the circular and local economy with fewer emissions. Incentivizing local supply and demand can ultimately reduce costs, benefitting small and medium businesses and consumers. This can improve levels inclusion especially in the context of global food shortages. Blockchain technology can track these circular economies, including local supply chains and validating responsible agricultural practices (e.g., use of chemicals and pesticides). This transparency and efficiency can help ensure adequate stable food supplies to meet the needs of a given community, ultimately bringing more integrity into the food industry. An added benefit would be that shorter shipment times and a shorter shelf life prior to consumption preserves higher nutritional density and can support health outcomes. Incentive structures can also be created for activities like composting, to support further local food production. Waste Management: Waste to energy systems, where waste produced by a household can be utilized to produce power, can provide monetary benefits for households and be verified with blockchain and tokenized assets. Incentive structures can also reward households that demonstrate more sustainable behaviors with their waste, such as NFTs or other tokens to enable additional purchases or other benefits. IoT technologies including sensors can detect areas where waste is being managed more responsibly Water Usage: Much like with carbon markets, blockchain technology can facilitate water trading as an exchange of water rights, or allocations, between buyers and sellers. Blockchain can be useful to make trading activity more efficient, helping match buyers and sellers, increasing competition to lower prices. Added transparency can addresses concerns over provenance issues and improve trust. Moreover, as wastewater can be treated and reutilized to support a permaculture, tracking and tracing mechanisms can enhance the validity, scalability, and impact of these processes.

Blockchain can facilitate a transition away from dependence on a small number of massively produced fossil fuel sources, to reliance on numerous renewable energy sources, each of which can be small in its production capacity. Blockchain technology can be an effective accounting system for grid management for renewable energies, with the necessary pricing flexibility to adapt to changing supply and demand dynamics. Tokenization can facilitate local energy production and trading, so that individual households can benefit economically from excess energy sales. Competitive markets for energy can permit buyers to bid on offerings by sellers. Blockchain technology can make these markets more efficient and transparent, enhancing opportunities for individuals to competitively bid for electrical generating capacity as buyers on wholesale markets (e.g., deregulated energy markets in some US states), or purchase energy in retail markets, allowing for price negotiations for renewable rates. Microgrids are also increasing in popularity, with opportunities to provide energy back into the main grid (e.g., powering electric vehicles). With blockchain, Pricing can be made more transparent based on the competitive landscape, energy projects’ characteristics, and aspects like scope and cost. Smart contracts can limit credit risk and collateral requirements, putting funds on escrow and ensuring delivery of energy upon payment. Certificates of origin of energy, as well as renewable energy certificates (RECs) can also be validated by, unbundled, and sold separately in marketplaces. Access to energy subsidies can also be facilitated in relevant jurisdictions that authorize RECs, especially for cases where renewable energies may be more expensive (e.g., off-shore wind). Incentive structures enabled by blockchain can also provide tools to significantly increase sales, tracing, and reporting of renewable energies. Finally, blockchain can facilitate the implementation of legal orders with partial oversight over energy markets that align incentives toward renewable capacity production.

{"text": "III. NET ZERO APPROACH FOR BLOCKCHAIN As blockchain technology is being utilized to help other sectors meet sustainability requirements, the blockchain space itself must address these issues as an industry. It is important to consider that using blockchain as a solution to advance sustainability goals in other sectors also brings tradeoffs, defined by the energy use and sustainability factors of the blockchain being utilized. Just like in any other industry, the blockchain space also has to address sustainability requirements, especially as defined by carbon emissions and reporting requirements. Addressing these issues is also subject to legal, regulatory, and other requirements, which are important to determine and comply with as the space matures. In most cases, blockchain activities can couple initiatives to decarbonize their activities over time with tokenized carbon credits to address residual emissions. Yet as for calculating past emissions, and current emissions for reporting purposes, there is a significant amount of nuance. Layer 1 blockchains, which refer to the foundational level of blockchain architecture on which other applications are built, must determine the costs and utility tradeoffs, and make sure they are addressing sustainability concerns. Reducing and controlling emissions is a way to prevent these technologies from expanding sustainability issues across the broad array of applications that are built on them. While the Bitcoin network has been known to utilize significant amounts of energy with its proof-of-work validation mechanism, Ethereum got past this issue when it transitioned from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake and reduced an estimated 99.9% of emissions. Therefore, it is important to consider that not all blockchains utilize the same consensus mechanisms, which leads to different sustainability issues across their respective networks. Industry communications and messaging on sustainability have yet to be made clear across the blockchain space; yet there has been significant progress. Several blockchain networks, for instance, that have positioned themselves for enterprise use, have also developed energy efficient operations and ambitious net-zero goals. Ensuring the sustainability of blockchain technology as an industry starts with a clear methodology to measure environmental impacts across blockchain networks. This points to the need to ensure the data to be collected, reported, and monitored. When it comes to carbon emissions, which are the major concern, it is important to consistently define what activities comprise direct and indirect emissions according to generally accepted and standardized convention: • Scope 1: Direct emissions from operations owned and controlled by an entity. o For blockchains, in most cases there are very few, if any direct emissions. In some cases, however, there may be emissions resulting from direct operations at the miner level. If Bitcoin have ownership of their power generation in terms of equity and operational control, then they produce Scope 1 emissions. Miners may purchase their source of energy to generate the electricity that powers their mining activities. In this case, the power generation is part of the miner’s assets. • Scope 2: Indirect emissions from energy purchased by an entity. o For blockchains, Scope 2 is essential, as it is where most of the action is with respect to emissions. The bulk of these emissions are Scope 2. It points to activity at the node level, referring to the electricity purchased (not controlled at the source) to power operations.

Electric grid coefficients for different countries, at a subnational region,or at the utility level, can be utilized to measure this data at increasingly granular levels. o It may also be important to understand the supply and real estate related to carbon emissions. The buildings and physical infrastructure where energy is generated may have an impact on emissions. This can be estimated with insight on embedded emissions in building materials, though it may not always be relevant. • Scope 3: Indirect emissions across an entity’s value chain. o For blockchains, this can refer to the emissions of a chain that builds on a separate main chain, a Layer 1. Layer 1 emissions flow through to Layer 2 that runs on a Layer 1, as purchased goods or services, which can be accounted for as Scope 3 in the value chain.

{"text": "Digital assets have certain unique characteristics that can present challenges for consistent measurement and reporting of emissions. Existing measurement frameworks don’t necessarily incorporate how emissions can and should be measured as starting point. When considering emissions per transaction, these can generally be considered Scope 2 or Scope 3, depending on the design of a network and the nature of its operations. The vast majority of blockchain digital asset operations will interplay between Scope 2 and Scope 3 in different ways, where one chain’s Scope 2 can be another chain’s Scope 3 emissions. It is necessary to have accurate accounting for all these activities. It is important to define what net zero means in the context of a given blockchain network and its operations, given the wide array of issues encountered on reporting emissions, and potential actions to take to address those issues. • Measurement: Blockchain enables increased granularity when it comes to emissions and activities (e.g., automating emissions analysis and data stored on chain). . Moreover, insights extracting data recorded on blockchains can also be used for emission metrics. • Reporting: Voluntary standards and reporting frameworks can be adopted by blockchain providers, which can demonstrate adherence to existing requirements for climate reporting in addition to climate impact investing initiatives. Yet there may still be gaps in how standards are written and how emissions are generated by blockchain networks, such that there may be a possibility to make claims that are not supported by real world impacts. • Regulatory Requirements: As financial entities are being required to report on emissions (e.g., EU MiCA regulation establishing emissions reporting requirements for financial companies, Greenhouse Gas Protocol and its approaches, standards), decisions to purchase digital assets are increasingly tied to regulatory drivers to understand the nature of underlying emissions. There are several approaches to calculate a network’s emissions, and existing methodologies have achieved a certain level of standardization to calculate and measure emissions: • Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance - Bitcoin & Ethereum Emissions Calculations: https:// ccaf.io/cbnsi/cbeci/ghg/methodology • Climate Action Data Trust: https://climateactiondata.org/how-blockchain-technology-addresses- the-double-counting-of-carbon-emissions/ • Crypto Carbon Ratings Institute (CCRI): https://carbon-ratings.com/dl/whitepaper-mica- methods-2024 • Rocky Mountain Institute: https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/principles_for_blockchain_ based_emissions_reporting.pdf • Societe Generale: https://www.sgforge.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SGF_Carbon-footprint- report_2023-11-20.pdf • South Pole: https://www.southpole.com/blog/accounting-for-the-climate-impacts-of- cryptocurrency 143", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "page_number": 146, "chunk_id": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50_p146_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241202113952-06'00'"}}

Are there any privacy issues that should be taken into account when utilizing geographical insight on nodes for the purpose of calculating emissions? 5. What additional activities is a Layer 1 chain enabling in other sectors, and how can the chain’s activities be utilized to help transition to net zero across the value chain? 6. How does a change in one place of the value chain flow through the blockchain and digital assets space as a whole, and how should emissions be calculated and allocated to the designated stakeholders adequately? 7. How can these changes fit within a normal net zero trajectory, to align with broader emission reduction goals? Recommendations/Considerations: 1. Define sustainability-focused activities for the sector as a whole, to facilitate better net-zero alignment 2. Develop a more granular approach to metrics, to confront increasing greenwashing concerns. 3. Optimize systems & controls around performance assessments in addition to methodologies. 4. A sector wide approach to metrics should also consider data at a granular level in addition to high level data. 5. Refer to existing reporting frameworks and methodologies available for reporting on emissions, providing granular data to the extent possible. 6. If emissions are avoided (e.g., building on a more energy efficient system, or benefitting from the Ethereum Merge’s reduction in emissions), consider if that can be considered a part of a net zero strategy 7. Consider to what extent activities outside the blockchain and digital assets space may play in the discussion of net zero alignment and transition plans 8. Identify additional activities beyond mining and transactions that may have an impact on emissions. Reducing emissions in additional activities in exchange for value from mining or transactions may be beneficial. 9. Identify these additional core activities that can create value in chains, and can be used to allocate emissions fairly across participants. 10. Define what the technology is being used for, and implications for offsetting approaches for Scope 3. 11. Consider a consistent approach for measurement and reporting in cases where one chain’s Scope 2 is another chain’s Scope 3 emissions. 12.

Be transparent regarding prior practices on emissions calculation, especially if different from current approaches, explain progress and evolution of calculations, and disclose additional issues that need to be considered. CONCLUSION: A FRAMEWORK FOR BUILDING AND MAINTAINING A SUSTAINABILITY PROOF BLOCKCHAIN ECOSYSTEM: The development of any blockchain enabled sustainability application requires a careful thought around the key success factors that helps cement its posture and capability to navigate and overcome historical challenges, and particularly inaccurate accounting and reporting of carbon and gas emissions and decarbonization efforts. A framework that considers the following key aspects can be beneficial for a developing sustainability proof blockchain ecosystem: 1. Transparency: despite the blockchain promise and reality of operating on distributed ledger technologies, making it tamper proof and transparent by design, there are still ways to avoid full transparency. For example, for certain hybrid models sourcing and collecting data may involve manual ways such as feeding data initially on spreadsheets, and then transferring those to the sustainability blockchain application either manually or using AI which may present a risk of loss or evasion of fully reporting on sustainability data. Therefore, mechanisms that allows for a comprehensive identification of the key sources of information, value and inputs that the blockchain users, beneficiaries, regulators and investors can rely on to understand how emissions and decarbonization data is collected, captured, synthesized, processed, reported and disseminated to the concerned stakeholders is fundamental. This also requires recognizing the importance of adopting some of the world’s leading sustainability standards and frameworks, while noting the necessity for customization according to the specific circumstances of the applications working environment. For example, places where weak communication infrastructure and services exist may require sustainability blockchain applications be capable to operate with hybrid connectivity modes to ease the collection and capturing of emissions and decarbonization data on chain. 2. Trust: building upon the transparency by design outcomes, a reliable and trusted route is possible if the data infrastructure is built in an accessible way that showcase the emissions and decarbonization journey from start to end to the concerned stakeholders. Moreover, devising a clear set of metrics throughout this journey becomes crucial for the concerned stakeholders, as it will act as a benchmark for measuring progress and improvement in achieving sustainability targets over the long run. 3. Accountability: assigning clear roles and responsibilities for teams and professionals involved in the emissions tracking and decarbonization process is paramount for identifying sources of issues and bottlenecks that requires immediate attention and resolution, as well as identifying opportunities for enhanced levels of streamlining, tracking, reporting, recognizing and incentivizing sustainability efforts and activities. 145", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "page_number": 148, "chunk_id": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50_p148_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241202113952-06'00'"}}

The pilot was launched for a CBDC in both Wholesale and Retail segments. The Wholesale pilot, termed the Digital Rupee - Wholesale (e₹-W), was introduced on November 1, 2022, with its primary use case being the settlement of secondary market transactions in government securities. This initiative aims to enhance the efficiency of the inter-bank market by reducing transaction costs and eliminating the need for settlement guarantee infrastructure or collateral to mitigate risks. The Retail pilot, called the Digital Rupee - Retail (e₹-R), was launched on December 1, 2022, within a closed user group comprising selected customers and merchants. The e₹-R, a digital token representing legal tender, is issued in denominations equivalent to physical currency and distributed through banks. Users can transact via digital wallets provided by participating banks, enabling Person-to-Person (P2P) and Person-to-Merchant (P2M) transactions. Like cash, the e₹-R ensures trust, safety, and settlement finality, but does not earn interest and is convertible to other forms of money.

Regulatory Measures for Curbing Spam with Blockchain Integration13 The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has urged MeitY to take decisive action against the rising wave of spam and phishing communications occurring on over-the-top (OTT) apps like WhatsApp and Telegram. While Trai and the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) have been implementing measures to curb spam calls and messages that often facilitate financial fraud, OTT platforms fall under MeitY’s regulatory purview, creating a gap in oversight for these newer communication channels. In a recent meeting of the joint committee of regulators, Trai officials emphasized the need for MeitY to address this issue collaboratively. Trai has already implemented measures such as a blockchain- based distributed ledger technology (DLT) platform for telecom operators to manage and regulate commercial traffic effectively. However, this solution does not extend to OTT communication channels, leaving them outside its scope of enforcement. 153", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_gbbc_io_gsmi50.pdf", "page_number": 156, "chunk_id": "www_gbbc_io_gsmi50_p156_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241202113952-06'00'"}}
{"text": "To strengthen protections against spam, Trai recently directed telecom operators to block messages containing unverified URLs, OTT links, APKs (Android application packages), or call-back numbers starting October 1. Entities like banks and e-commerce platforms must whitelist their information with telecom operators, who then integrate it into their DLT systems. Only messages that match this registered data are allowed to pass through, ensuring an additional layer of security for users. Trai continues to advocate for a joint regulatory framework to comprehensively address spam across both traditional and digital communication platforms. 2.6.2. Anti-money laundering (AML) provisions14 India has introduced anti-money laundering (AML) measures targeting cryptocurrency platforms and virtual digital asset (VDA) transactions to enhance financial transparency, curb criminal activities, and prevent terrorist financing. These provisions bring cryptocurrency trading, safekeeping, and related financial services under the ambit of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, marking a significant step in regulating the digital asset sector. The federal government issued a gazette notification mandating intermediaries dealing with VDAs, including crypto exchanges, to implement robust “know your customer” (KYC) protocols for all users. These entities, now classified as “reporting entities” under PMLA, must also notify the Financial Intelligence Unit India (FIU-IND) of any suspicious activities. Additionally, they are required to maintain detailed records of all transactions, especially those involving cash amounts exceeding INR 1 million (US$12,191), for at least five years. Transactions closely related within a month that cumulatively exceed this threshold must also be documented. The directive specifies that various VDA-related transactions are now subject to PMLA compliance. These include exchanges between VDAs and fiat currencies, transactions between different VDAs, VDA transfers, safekeeping or administration of VDAs, and financial services related to the issuance and sale of VDAs. This comprehensive approach underscores India’s commitment to fostering a transparent and secure digital asset ecosystem. 3.
