{"text": "OPN CHAIN WHITEPAPER ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 2025 1. Abstract This whitepaper outlines the architecture, design principles, and features of a groundbreaking Layer 1 blockchain built on the Cosmos SDK framework. Our innovative blockchain, referred to as OPNChain, combines the power of Cosmos SDK with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility, offering developers and users a seamless and efficient experience in building and deploying decentralized applications. The Cosmos SDK is a blockchain development framework designed to facilitate the creation of flexible, customizable, and scalable blockchain solutions. At the same time, the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) serves as the runtime environment for smart contracts on Ethereum, enabling developers to build decentralized applications (DApps) with on-chain smart contracts. OPNChain combines these advanced technologies to deliver a robust platform that integrates security, scalability, and interoperability, addressing the complex needs of modern blockchain applications. By leveraging the strengths of the Cosmos SDK and EVM, OPNChain empowers a wide range of use cases. These include decentralized and personalized AI-driven applications (AI Agents), tokenization of tangible assets to enhance liquidity and accessibility (Real-World Assets), management and incentivization of IoT-driven networks like EV charging stations and telecom infrastructure (DePIN), and distributed AI model training, privacy-preserving data exchange, and ethical AI governance (DeFAI). This integration makes OPNChain a pioneering platform for driving innovation and supporting the next generation of decentralized applications. 2.
