{"text": "Crypto Theses 2025 Introduction Welcome to the 2025 edition of The Theses! 2024 was a year of transformation and resilience for the crypto industry. After navigating the turbulence of the previous cycle, the sector demonstrated significant strides in rebuilding trust, fostering innovation, and maturing as a financial and technological ecosystem. • We saw the long-awaited ETFs come to fruition, legitimizing the asset class, and finally bringing in the institutions. They are here, for real. • 2024 will go down in history as the defining year for the evolution of crypto policy. At the very least, a friendlier US regulatory environment should remove a lot of risk for allocators who were debating gaining exposure to the space. • The election was the catalyst that finally propelled BTC across the $100,000 mark. • Solana crossed the chasm and morphed what was once a two-horse race between Bitcoin and Ethereum into a trifecta – all while Ethereum faced an identity crisis. • The year brought plenty of evidence that crypto has onboarded new users – examples include the success of Polymarket, Telegram mini-apps, and Hyperliquid. • Memecoins often dominated the narrative and further helped bring in new users. But outside of speculation, DePIN also had a breakout year. The sector more than doubled its market cap and showed real-world usage among businesses and consumers. Messari research kept you on the cutting edge of crypto this year. We continued to put Wall 4", "metadata": {"source_file": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "page_number": 4, "chunk_id": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025_p4_c1"}}

In 2022, we put DePIN on the map (we even invented the term). This year, we covered the sector extensively against the backdrop of its breakout year. We were also ahead of the curve on a number of new protocols and narratives – including Glow, Hyperliquid, Aerodrome, and Bittensor. At the same time, we kept you on your toes on the emerging memecoin narrative, exploring how it could be a legitimate onboarding mechanism. Finally, we brought you ongoing coverage of the developments in AI x Crypto, another area that we were early to cover last year. There are two main sections to the 2025 Theses. We are starting with “The State of Crypto”, which includes shorter essays on the crypto meta in 2024. In the “Sector Theses” we go over the narratives and forward-looking theses for major sectors.

{"text": "Crypto Theses 2025 Legacy Markets If there ever were a year to embody “climbing a wall of worry,” 2024 might be it. After surviving the onslaught of inflation in 2022 and 2023, investors were still glancing over their shoulders in fear of its return. When it became more clear that inflation had moderated, the focus shifted to a weakening labor market, begging the question: did the Fed overtighten or wait too long? The uptick in the unemployment rate triggered a lot of discussion about the Sahm Rule, an economic indicator used to signal the early stages of recession. The rule states that a recession is likely to start when the three-month moving average of the unemployment rate (UR) rises 0.5% or more above its low of the past twelve months. Luckily for the fate of the US economy, the creator of the signal, Claudia Sahm, noted that the UR increase was tied to an uptick in labor force participation driven by immigration. She thought that the Fed had plenty of room to cut interest rates and that the US consumer (and economy more broadly) was fairly resilient, likely making the signal void this time around. The Fed followed through with its first 50 bps cut in September of this year, followed by a 25 bps cut in November. 8", "metadata": {"source_file": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "page_number": 8, "chunk_id": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025_p8_c1"}}

{"text": "Crypto Theses 2025 Besides brief clusters of volatility around the yen-carry trade unwind, geopolitical conflicts, and standard election-driven hedging, the S&P has been on a steady upward trend for most of this year. In fact, the S&P’s ~27% return YTD (at time of writing) puts it around the top 20% of all years since inception. 2024 was largely a year of continued risk asset strength after the recovery of 2023. Other notable macro highlights: • The market is beginning to price in the potential for AI-driven productivity boosts. • Large demand for gold reserves from global central banks, particularly, China, India, Turkey, and others - leading to a parabolic price move in GLD. • Energy costs remain fairly muted despite geopolitical tensions throughout the year - the price of crude has not budged much as the market is generally oversupplied from US production. • China has shifted to a more accommodating monetary stance as it lowers interest rates, implements lending programs, and actively injects liquidity through various channels in order to prop up its markets. Crypto Markets While legacy markets trended up for most of the year, crypto had to deal with its own wall of worry after BTC’s local top in March. While crypto markets were reactive on the downside to all of the risks that traditional markets faced (Yen carry trade unwind, geopolitical tensions, changes in monetary policy, etc.), it also faced its own idiosyncratic headwinds: • German government selling • Mt Gox distributions • Alleged Tether DOJ investigation • A hostile regulatory environment with SEC lawsuits (or Wells Notices) against Uniswap, Kraken, Coinbase, Metamask, Robinhood, and others The election was the catalyst that broke the market out of an eight-month period of consolidation and volatility. While some may be giving Trump’s claims too much credit, the market also recognizes that even a neutral regulatory environment is an improvement over what we had the last four years. 10", "metadata": {"source_file": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "page_number": 10, "chunk_id": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025_p10_c1"}}
{"text": "Crypto Theses 2025 Looking Forward Going forward, the macro backdrop is fairly supportive as we look into 2025. While the Fed has pulled back on the monetary tightening conducted since 2022, it has not truly started easing just yet. Volatility across equities, bonds, and forex has largely been squashed post-election. As volatility tends to cluster, low volatility should beget future low volatility; this is ultimately good for risk assets like BTC, ETH, and SOL. While there is an expectation of positive catalysts with a Trump presidency that sets up for possible disappointment, a friendlier regulatory environment removes many possible negative outcomes going forward. That certainly makes crypto majors more attractive for allocators who may not have had exposure for those reasons. 11", "metadata": {"source_file": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "page_number": 11, "chunk_id": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025_p11_c1"}}

{"text": "Crypto Theses 2025 2024 was a turning point for crypto policy, setting the stage for transformative developments in 2025. The first half of the year saw an intense struggle over the industry’s direction, with the SEC asserting its authority through aggressive enforcement actions. In response, the crypto sector, supported by allies in Congress, pushed back by advocating for clear, tailored legislation and pursuing judicial interventions to limit regulatory overreach. In the latter half of the year, the political landscape shifted drastically as the Trump Campaign adopted a pro-crypto stance. With Trump’s eventual victory, expectations for a more favorable regulatory environment surged, establishing 2024 as a defining year for the evolution of crypto policy. The SEC’s Enforcement Blitz: The SEC, led by Chair Gary Gensler, intensified its “regulation by enforcement” approach in 2024, targeting major players across the crypto industry. High-profile cases rolling over from 2023 against Coinbase and Binance accused them of operating as unregistered securities exchanges, brokers, and clearing agencies, reflecting the SEC’s broad interpretation of existing securities laws. The agency also set its sights on DeFi protocols like Uniswap, alleging unregistered securities offerings, and extended its reach into the creator economy by pursuing NFT projects for similar violations. While these actions led to some settlements and fines, they drew widespread criticism for stifling innovation and pushing crypto businesses to relocate offshore. The SEC’s refusal to engage in rulemaking, despite repeated calls from industry and some members of Congress, further fueled frustration and calls for legislative intervention. The SEC’s arguments in court, particularly its assertion that secondary market sales of crypto assets constitute investment contracts, were met with mixed results, highlighting the legal uncertainty surrounding the application of the Howey test to digital assets. The Debt Box case, where the SEC was sanctioned for making misleading statements to the court, further damaged the agency’s credibility and fueled calls for greater oversight. Congressional Push for Regulatory Clarity: In response to the SEC’s aggressive enforcement and the growing regulatory uncertainty, the House, under Republican leadership, made significant strides in advancing crypto-specific legislation. FIT-21, a comprehensive market structure bill, passed the House with a surprising level of bipartisan support, signaling a growing recognition that tailored rules for digital assets are necessary. 13", "metadata": {"source_file": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "page_number": 13, "chunk_id": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025_p13_c1"}}
{"text": "Crypto Theses 2025 The Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act also advanced in the House, demonstrating bipartisan interest in establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins. However, these bills faced an uphill battle in the Democrat-controlled Senate, where the focus remained on addressing illicit finance concerns through proposals like DAAMLA and CANSEE, which the industry viewed as overly broad and potentially harmful to innovation. Despite the Senate roadblocks, bipartisan efforts to address tax reporting requirements for digital asset brokers and promote blockchain innovation in non-financial sectors gained traction, suggesting potential areas for compromise in the future. The House also passed a resolution to repeal SAB-121, an SEC accounting rule that deterred banks from custodying digital assets, though President Biden ultimately vetoed the resolution. Election of Donald Trump: Trump made a series of promises to the crypto industry, including: • Establish a Bitcoin and crypto advisory council dedicated to establishing clear rules of the road, composed of industry representatives • End the “unlawful and un-American Crypto crackdown” • Hold onto Bitcoin acquired by the federal government as a strategic reserve asset • Defend the right to mine Bitcoin • Remove SEC Chair Gensler • Oppose a U.S. CBDC • Make the U.S. the “crypto capital” of the world • Protect the right to self-custody and to “transact free from Government Surveillance and Control” • Free Ross Ulbricht, creator of the Silk Road As a result, the crypto industry widely anticipates a highly favorable policy environment under the Trump Administration. Emerging Themes: A number of emerging themes also characterized crypto policy in 2024. • Self-Custody Rights: The right to self-custody became a key issue, with some policymakers advocating for restrictions while others championed its importance for 14", "metadata": {"source_file": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "page_number": 14, "chunk_id": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025_p14_c1"}}
{"text": "Crypto Theses 2025 individual financial freedom. • Operation Choke Point 2.0 Allegations: Concerns grew over allegations that banking regulators were unfairly targeting and debanking crypto firms, raising fears of systemic bias against the industry. • Privacy vs. Illicit Finance: The use of mixers and privacy-enhancing technologies in crypto sparked debate, as policymakers sought to balance privacy rights with the need to combat illicit activity. • Bitcoin Mining and Energy Consumption: Proposals for data collection and taxation on Bitcoin mining highlighted its environmental impact, while advocates emphasized its potential to drive renewable energy innovation. • Crypto Lobbying Efforts: The influence of crypto lobbying surged in 2024, with industry stakeholders ramping up efforts to educate policymakers and push for favorable regulations. The crypto sector entered the top five lobbying spenders of the year, with total expenditures estimated at $200 million. Crypto Policy Theses for 2025 Regulatory Clarity Emerges, but Not From the SEC The Trump administration, supported by a Republican-controlled Congress, is set to prioritize reshaping crypto regulations. A key move will be appointing a new SEC Chair and commissioners who are more open to innovation and industry engagement. However, lasting regulatory clarity is expected to come from Congress rather than the SEC. With majorities in both chambers, Republicans are motivated to fulfill campaign promises by advancing legislation that establishes clear and supportive guidelines for the digital asset ecosystem. Expect a modified version of FIT-21, incorporating elements of the Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Act and addressing Senate concerns regarding illicit finance, to be a top legislative priority. Passage of such legislation would establish a much-needed framework for digital asset issuers and intermediaries, clarifying jurisdictional lines between the SEC and CFTC, streamlining registration processes, and establishing tailored disclosure requirements. The shift from regulatory uncertainty to a clear legal framework would also likely encourage institutional adoption and further integrate digital assets into the traditional financial system. Stablecoin Legislation Gets Signed Into Law The stars are aligned for stablecoin legislation in 2025. With bipartisan support in Congress and a Trump Administration eager to promote financial innovation, a comprehensive stablecoin bill is 15", "metadata": {"source_file": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "page_number": 15, "chunk_id": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025_p15_c1"}}
{"text": "Crypto Theses 2025 highly likely to be enacted. The final legislation will likely draw heavily from Chair McHenry’s Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act, incorporating a strengthened federal floor for state-qualified issuers and provisions addressing AML/CFT concerns to appease Senate Democrats. Expect a robust state pathway for issuers, fostering competition and innovation in the stablecoin market. Establishing a federal stablecoin framework would bring crucial regulatory clarity, encouraging mainstream adoption, integration into payment systems, and strengthening the U.S. dollar’s position in global finance. With BRICS developing an alternative financial system—a move Trump has opposed, threatening 100% tariffs on adopters—the Administration may view U.S. dollar- backed stablecoins as a strategic tool to counter BRICS’ influence. The future of decentralized stablecoins like DAI remains uncertain. While a regulatory framework for centralized stablecoins could accelerate their adoption, it may also place decentralized alternatives at a disadvantage due to challenges in meeting regulatory requirements. This shift could further strengthen the dominance of centralized stablecoins like USDC and USDT. The ability of decentralized stablecoins to retain market share will hinge on their adaptability to the new regulatory environment and their capacity to demonstrate unique value in a more regulated ecosystem. However, innovation in decentralized stablecoins may stall, potentially delaying the realization of a fully decentralized financial system. CBDC Development Continues, but Retail is Off the Table Under a Trump Administration and a Republican-controlled Congress, a retail CBDC is highly unlikely. However, research and development of wholesale CBDCs will continue at the Federal Reserve. The Fed will explore potential use cases for wholesale CBDCs in cross-border payments and settlements, working with industry stakeholders to address privacy and security concerns. Legislation will likely be enacted to explicitly prohibit the Fed from issuing a retail CBDC without clear Congressional authorization, further solidifying the Republican Party’s stance on protecting financial privacy. This focus on wholesale CBDCs, while less impactful for individual consumers, could still have significant implications for the financial system, potentially improving efficiency and reducing costs for cross-border transactions. It could also create new opportunities for private sector innovation in developing and implementing CBDC-related technologies and services. Self-Custody is Protected, but Privacy Remains a Battleground With a Republican majority in Congress and a Trump Administration committed to protecting individual liberties, the right to self-custody will likely be codified through legislation. 16", "metadata": {"source_file": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "page_number": 16, "chunk_id": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025_p16_c1"}}
{"text": "Crypto Theses 2025 This would safeguard individuals’ ability to hold and control their own digital assets, a core tenet of the crypto community. However, the debate over privacy-enhancing technologies, like mixers, will persist. Expect targeted legislation aimed at addressing the illicit use of mixers, while also seeking to preserve privacy for lawful transactions. Policymakers face the challenge of balancing privacy rights, national security, and efforts to combat illicit finance. The outcome of this debate will significantly impact the future of financial privacy, shaping the adoption of privacy-preserving technologies in both crypto and traditional finance. Striking the right balance is essential to foster innovation while addressing legitimate law enforcement needs. Hot Takes The following predictions outline scenarios that, while less likely than our primary theses, still have a moderate chance of materializing. DeFi Remains Unregulated Despite growing interest and concerns, DeFi will remain largely unregulated in 2025. However, Congress will commission a comprehensive study of DeFi, exploring its potential benefits, risks, and appropriate regulatory approaches. This study, involving input from industry stakeholders, academics, and regulators, will lay the groundwork for future legislation. Expect the study to address key issues such as consumer protection, illicit finance, and the unique challenges of regulating decentralized protocols. The findings of this study will be crucial in shaping the future of DeFi policy, potentially leading to tailored regulations that balance innovation with oversight. The implications of this prediction are significant. A period of continued regulatory uncertainty for DeFi could allow the sector to continue innovating and growing, potentially attracting more users and investment. However, it could also increase the risk of scams, hacks, and other illicit activities, potentially harming consumers and undermining trust in the sector.

A shift toward a hostile stance on crypto could occur if an economic crisis undermines the dollar’s position, particularly if capital flows into crypto or if the BRICS financial system gains significant traction. 2025 is Make or Break for Ambitious Crypto Reform If the most ambitious pro-crypto policies are to be enacted, they will likely need to occur within the first year of Trump’s presidency. By the 2026 midterms, Congress could shift back to Democratic control, and Trump’s political capital may wane as his presidency progresses. Similar to Joe Biden’s diminished leverage after the partial failure of Build Back Better, Trump could face comparable legislative challenges later in his term, making large-scale crypto reforms increasingly unlikely. Conclusion After facing much uncertainty, the outlook for crypto policy in the U.S. has never looked better. Should the Trump Administration implement even a small fraction of Trump’s campaign promises, the crypto industry is bound to benefit significantly. However, the risk of a reversal in sentiment towards crypto is not zero, and stagnation in legislative advancement is not unlikely. Much remains to be proven, but the crypto industry has good grounds to be optimistic. 18", "metadata": {"source_file": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "page_number": 18, "chunk_id": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025_p18_c1"}}

{"text": "Crypto Theses 2025 Looking Back: Solana’s Journey in 2024 In many ways, 2024 was the year of Solana, with the SOL token appreciating by around 120% year-to-date, while its market capitalization relative to Ethereum grew from about 16% to over 25% by year-end. Initially, Solana’s rise was largely driven by speculation around its potential to evolve into a competitive blockchain ecosystem, but by the close of the year, its fundamentals began to substantiate that promise. In 2024, Token Extensions introduced a new SPL standard that offered greater flexibility for developers. Released in Q1, these extensions gained adoption, signaling a significant step forward for institutional use cases. Paypal’s PYUSD adoption stood out, leveraging the standard for confidential transfers and showcasing how institutional players could utilize Solana’s infrastructure for advanced token functionalities. This development underscores the growing alignment between Solana’s technical advancements and institutional needs. The phased rollout of Firedancer, alongside innovations like ZK Compression for cost-efficient on-chain storage, further bolstered Solana’s technical reputation. These upgrades not only enhanced performance but also captured significant attention, reinforcing Solana’s position as a true competitor to Ethereum. The combination of low-cost, high-throughput transactions and a growing narrative drove the expansion of Solana’s application ecosystem. Total fees generated by Solana applications exceeded those on Ethereum, with Solana apps contributing over $500 million—more than half of all on-chain application fees during the period. At first glance, this suggests a diverse ecosystem comparable to Ethereum’s. However, a closer look at the distribution of fees reveals a more concentrated landscape. 24", "metadata": {"source_file": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "page_number": 24, "chunk_id": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025_p24_c1"}}
{"text": "Crypto Theses 2025 Currently, application fees on Solana are highly concentrated in two primary areas: liquid staking and trading activities. Liquid staking accounts for approximately 25% of the application fees, driven by network staking rewards, while trading fees—generated by decentralized exchanges (DEXs), DEX aggregators, and even Telegram bots—represent around 50% of the network’s total application fees. This proportion is significantly higher than Ethereum’s, where trading fees typically make up 20-30% of total application fees, briefly exceeding 40% during recent market rallies. The outsized share of trading fees on Solana can largely be attributed to its position as the primary execution platform for memecoin speculation. While the dominance of memecoin volumes has bolstered fee growth, it also highlights the relative lack of diversity within the Solana ecosystem. Use cases that are prominent on Ethereum—such as lending, yield farming, and liquid staking—have yet to gain comparable traction on Solana. If 2024 was indeed the year of Solana as an asset, 2025 may well mark the year of Solana as a fully realized ecosystem. While Solana’s fee generation underscores its strong position in spot trading, the broader ecosystem began to show signs of growth beyond trading in 2024. The advent of DePIN (decentralized physical infrastructure networks) applications, and emerging AI- driven projects signals Solana’s expanding footprint in areas beyond finance. However, the scale of these developments is still in the early stages, and their ultimate impact on network activity remains uncertain.

Memecoins 2024 Crypto Review: Memecoins, Speculation, and Emerging Trends In 2024, memecoins dominated the narrative in crypto, capturing significant mindshare with multiple individual memes creating generational wealth. Despite representing less than 3% of the top 300 cryptocurrencies by market cap (excluding stablecoins), memecoins consistently accounted for 6-7% of total non-stablecoin trading volume, with recent weeks pushing that figure to nearly 11%. This outsized volume underscores sustained interest in speculative assets, even though memecoins remain a small segment of the market. The first quarter’s rally, driven by political memes like Jeo Boden, marked a resurgence in memecoin market share, which then grew from 1.5% to 3%. This was followed by rallies fueled by TikTok memes (Moodeng and Chill Guy) and more recently, the rise of AI Agents, sparked by Truth Terminal’s GOAT. 25", "metadata": {"source_file": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "page_number": 25, "chunk_id": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025_p25_c1"}}

They thrive in environments with surplus capital and ample blockspace for transactions. As the broader crypto market appreciated in 2024, many traders found themselves with excess capital and limited quality investment opportunities. This created a fertile ground for memecoins, which offered high-risk, high-reward potential. This dynamic was especially evident on high-throughput networks like Solana and Base. After a strong market performance in late 2023 and early 2024, Solana users found themselves with extra capital and limited deployable opportunities. This was highlighted by Solana’s significantly lower number of tokens—excluding memecoins—compared to Ethereum, pushing users further out on the risk curve toward memecoins. Solana’s scalability and low transaction costs made it an ideal environment for these speculative assets.

This is a remarkable data point, but the truth is, nobody knows how many real users are actually adopting crypto. Active addresses and users do not hold a 1:1 relationship given that many crypto natives use multiple wallets, and the presence of sybils can greatly muddy addresses as a metric. By filtering through some of the noise, a16z estimates that roughly 30-60 million of those 220 million active addresses are real monthly crypto users.

{"text": "Crypto Theses 2025 DePIN Theses for 2025 DePIN Sector Revenue Surpasses $150 Million in 2025 DePIN entered 2024 with established supply sides but limited revenue on the demand sides to validate the DePIN model. Several protocols generated 7-figure and even 8-figure revenues over the course of the year, showing initial promise of DePIN capturing the demand side which has constrained growth so far. GLOW exceeded $25 million in revenue, while Helium and IO.net both surpassed $12 million. Furthermore, Filecoin ($8 million), Render ($4 million), Akash ($4 million), and GEODNET ($2 million), among others, also surpassed the $1 million in ARR generated milestone. We anticipate that DePIN revenue growth will accelerate in 2025, surpassing $150 million generated. The 9-figure revenue milestone will help validate DePIN’s value proposition, firmly establishing the sector as crypto’s premier real-world use case. Energy (DeGEN) and Wireless (DeWi) Sub-Sectors Lead DePIN in Traction While the largest DePINs by market cap will remain mainly in the file storage and compute sub-sectors in 2025, the most growth and adoption will likely occur in the energy and wireless sectors. Both sectors saw leading startups emerge into public awareness, including DAWN, Glow, Daylight Energy, Starpower Energy, Fuse, XNET, and others. These startups are primed to launch mainnets or exit beta stages, opening the door to significant growth in 2025. Furthermore, the two largest DePINs by revenue (GLOW and Helium) are energy and wireless DePIN, respectively, demonstrating that these sectors capture real demand. With energy and wireless having the largest TAMs in DePIN, we expect the launch of promising protocols and continued growth of existing protocols in this sector to firmly establish these two sub-sectors as the most prominent in DePIN. Helium Becomes the Largest DePIN by Market Cap Helium ranks 9th in market cap among DePINs at the time of writing. With a growing carrier offload program, the continued growth of Helium Mobile, and simplified tokenomics with a singular focus on HNT, Helium is positioned to become the largest DePIN by market cap. While the boom in generative AI will continue to bolster compute-focused DePINs, Helium’s significant real-world adoption in the massive wireless market will lead the market to recognize Helium as the leading DePIN in 2025, and its relative valuation will reflect that. 41", "metadata": {"source_file": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "page_number": 41, "chunk_id": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025_p41_c1"}}
{"text": "Crypto Theses 2025 A Significant Government Integration/Partnership within DePIN is Initiated We foresee a major government forming a partnership or pursuing a significant DePIN-related initiative in 2025. In 2024, the U.S. Department of Agriculture partnered with GEODNET to offer high-precision agricultural services to farmers through GEODNET’s network. With a pro-crypto administration in office, the most compelling use cases in crypto will be examined for potential government involvement. Due to DePIN’s proven real-world utility, the sector will naturally emerge as an obvious target for furthering the government’s crypto adoption. The incoming AI and Crypto Czar, David Sacks, is an investor in Solana, Helium, Render, and Hivemapper, demonstrating his knowledge and interest in DePIN. With a pressing need for more energy to power generative AI and a transition to clean energy sources, we anticipate that the administration will seriously consider DePIN solutions. Furthermore, DePIN’s utility could help defend against criticism of the administration’s most ambitious crypto policy proposals, such as a strategic Bitcoin Reserve or eliminating capital gains taxes on crypto, making the sector a valuable tool to pursue pro-crypto policies more broadly. A Rival to Solana Emerges as the Primary Chain to Build DePINs On Solana became the clear blockchain destination for most DePINs in 2024, with a wide range of protocols both migrating to Solana and building natively on the chain. As a result of DePIN’s success over the last year, we’re already seeing other chains ramp up their efforts to attract DePINs and expect this trend to continue in 2025. Furthermore, two DePIN- specific chains, Peaq and IoTeX, launched in 2024, providing tailored solutions for DePINs and hands-on support that a general-purpose blockchain may not be able to provide. With DePINs prioritizing UX, access to liquidity, and DevX, we expect chains rating strong in these metrics to attract a greater share of DePINs in 2025. Base, in particular, could become a primary destination for DePINs due to its strong UX and DevX. Additionally, support from Coinbase could further accelerate adoption by onboarding users onto DePINs through various partnerships in the future. Demonstrating Base’s increasing attractiveness, DIMO announced a migration to Base in December, and two promising DePINs, Daylight and Blackbird, are also building on the chain. While Solana is the clear destination for DePINs in 2024, the protocol must actively work to maintain that status in 2025 and beyond. 42", "metadata": {"source_file": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "page_number": 42, "chunk_id": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025_p42_c1"}}

Saylor’s commitment to Bitcoin remains steadfast. In his commentary during MSTR’s Q3 earnings report in October he unveiled plans to raise $42 billion in new capital to fund additional Bitcoin purchases over the next three years. MicroStrategy (MSTR) has continued to lever up aggressively through convertible bond raises and regular equity offerings. As of early December, the company retained approximately $9 billion from its recent $21 billion at-the-market offering to purchase additional BTC in the coming weeks. However, MSTR’s decline from $525 to under $400 a share, following a parabolic rally, could pose challenges for future fundraising. During its period of rapid stock appreciation, MSTR capitalized on issuing low-cost convertible notes with high conversion premiums. Lenders willingly forewent coupon payments in favor of a relatively inexpensive option on a soaring stock. If MSTR’s stock price continues to decline and volatility diminishes, the value of these options may become less attractive, potentially hampering MicroStrategy’s ability to secure further funding for BTC purchases. This could create reflexively bearish dynamics for both BTC and MSTR, as Saylor’s role as a key marginal buyer becomes constrained. Despite these potential headwinds, MSTR’s BTC-centric strategy has inspired other public companies, such as Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA), Riot Platforms, and Semler Scientific, to begin accumulating BTC reserves, signaling a growing trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption. 48", "metadata": {"source_file": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "page_number": 48, "chunk_id": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025_p48_c1"}}

Bitcoin halving cycles occur every 4 years, with the amount of natural sellers for Bitcoin decreasing over time as miner rewards decrease. Looking Ahead - Predictions for 2025 and Beyond Bitcoin ETF inflows have largely exceeded expectations, and it is likely that institutions will slowly become the primary drivers of daily BTC price action over time. Unlike Microstrategy or perpetual traders on CEXs and DEXs, ETFs buy spot Bitcoin without the use of leverage. The smoother, more consistent spot inflows from institutions should lead to fewer reflexive, leverage- driven moves over time, helping Bitcoin mature as an asset. The approval of Bitcoin ETFs has likely moved BTC to the early middle stages of its journey to becoming the world’s leading store of value. In November, Bitcoin flipped silver to become the world’s eighth most valuable asset, partially as a result of ETF inflows throughout the year. Late-year trends suggest that ETF inflows will continue to increase into 2025, especially as Grayscale’s GBTC shifts to positive net flows.

While Bitcoin has rapidly repriced following Trump’s victory, eventually the administration will need to deliver on some of their claims. A federal strategic Bitcoin reserve would be particularly influential although we predict there is a low probability of this happening. The market seems to be approaching the Trump administration with guarded optimism, and if the President can achieve some of the higher-probability action items, it could build enough goodwill to sustain Bitcoin euphoria moving forward. Following the 2024 election, where the impact of clear and positive crypto reform became a needle moving issue across all governmental branches, we believe crypto is on the verge of bipartisan support.

The result was that for the first time ever, Bitcoin had “alts” on mainnet, with no change to the underlying network needed. Today Runes allow participants on the Bitcoin network to buy a growing number of memecoins and “culturecoins”, adding more diversity to the chain’s tradable assets.

{"text": "Crypto Theses 2025 Bitcoin Programmability - A Complete Overhaul The surge in Runes and Ordinals related activity has led a call-to-action for Bitcoin stakeholders and builders to consider allowing for greater programmability on the Bitcoin network. This demand stems from the Bitcoin network’s fundamental design, which prioritizes security and decentralization above all else. These trade-offs, while ensuring Bitcoin’s unparalleled resilience as a store of value, have historically limited its capacity to support expressive smart contracts or nuanced transaction types, such as those enabled by programmable virtual machines on Ethereum or Solana. The Bitcoin network was deliberately designed to fulfill a singular purpose: to be the most secure and decentralized digital currency. While this simplicity has fortified its role as “digital gold,” it also means that creating applications like decentralized finance (DeFi) or advanced transaction types has not been truly possible within Bitcoin’s base layer. BitVM has emerged as a significant catalyst for innovation, offering a way to execute arbitrary computations offchain and verify them on Bitcoin mainnet, similar to mechanisms employed by Ethereum rollups. This development opens up Bitcoin to the possibility of rollups, decentralized bridges, EVM-compatible smart contracts, and other foundational elements that are commonplace on more versatile blockchains today. Efforts to enhance programmability in the Bitcoin ecosystem are growing rapidly following BitVM, extending beyond base-layer protocols into the development of the “Bitcoin L2 Season” in 2024 with over 40 layers in testnet or mainnet. While many of these layers are still evolving into true Layer-2 solutions from sidechains, there is significant momentum toward less custodial and more Bitcoin-integrated models.

The emergence of BitVM and similar projects has fueled interest across various environments, laying the groundwork for future innovations and more sovereign, trust- minimized solutions. Bitcoin Staking - Evolving Utility for BTC A new development in 2024 was the introduction of Bitcoin staking. Babylon, launched in Q3 of the year, is Bitcoin’s first staking protocol, allowing BTC holders to stake their assets to secure other networks and earn rewards. Similar to Ethereum’s EigenLayer, Babylon leverages Bitcoin’s massive economic security for shared security across Proof-of-Stake (PoS) networks. Unlike current forms of BTC staking, bitcoin remains on its mainnet, and holders can delegate security without giving up control of their BTC. Babylon’s first staking round for 1,000 BTC occurred in August, hitting its cap within six blocks. Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs), like Lombard’s LBTC, allow staked BTC to be restaked into Babylon and other restaking protocols, enabling native yield while maintaining liquidity and DeFi composability. Over time as Babylon’s staking cap increases, more staked BTC will shift to Bitcoin mainnet, an exciting new yield source for native BTC holders.

For Ordinals, any revitalization in NFT sentiment will likely include leading Ordinals collections like Bitcoin Puppets and Node Monkes, which have formed communities all over crypto social media.

This space is worth monitoring, as AVSs and layers on Bitcoin could claim the utmost levels of decentralization and economic security, even compared to Ethereum. However, in 2024, consumers largely favored the performance capabilities of networks like Solana and Base, placing less emphasis on decentralization and security.

Or an L2 like Worldchain can allow for a certain number of free transactions per verified human without compromising the network health. As such, we believe execution is most likely to occur at the L2 layer. Native Layer-1s will always have to adapt to a different model like Celestia has for DA or settle for being good enough. Value Capture If the above is true and DA is also a commodity, it would seem that Layer-1s have a problem of 61", "metadata": {"source_file": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "page_number": 61, "chunk_id": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025_p61_c1"}}

Fees Are Not Important We recognize the importance of cash flows, but do not believe that fees are the primary driver for value of Layer-1 native assets like BTC, ETH, and SOL. First, current fees are primarily driven by speculation which may or may not last. Second, fees are typically denominated in the native asset itself which creates a circular problem for valuation. Third, we believe that low fees are good as long as the network economics are sustainable. Our crypto native model for valuing Layer-1s is Demand for Security. This model establishes a holistic positive relationship between a Layer-1 and all its applications. The largest application on a Layer-1 creates the highest demand for security, driving the native asset’s value. Even other models like store-of-value and medium-of-exchange may be directionally more correct than fees and cash flows. Capture More Fees Even if fees only set the floor, Ethereum may still want to capture more fees to be economically sustainable.

{"text": "Crypto Theses 2025 • Based and Native Rollups – Based and Native rollups use the Layer-1 for more functions and therefore allow it to capture more value. However, they have slower block times and as such worse UX and limited adoption. Future upgrades like preconfirmations and improvements like shorter block times can help improve their user experience. • Higher DA Fees – As discussed earlier, DA fees may either grow through market forces or can be increased by a protocol upgrade like EIP-7762. There is also a theoretical outcome that if DA fees enter price discovery and L2s compete to post blobs, Ethereum can indirectly capture fees from MEV on the L2. Only when this occurs, can it be empirically proven if Ethereum DA is differentiated, as L2s would switch to cheaper DA layers if it is not. • Scaling the Base Layer - A part of the community wants Ethereum execution to be good enough to compete with vanilla-EVM L2s. Max Resnick is a vocal supporter of the latter and has proposed improvements on the base layer like multiple concurrent proposers. These improvements will also help with interoperability between the Layer-2s which Ethereum desperately needs. ETH is Almost Good Ethereum has multiple paths to success. One mega rollup, a network of interconnected based- rollups, and high fee burn are all loose fundamentals that can make it the home once again for crypto natives and new entrants.

What once stood as a two-horse race between Bitcoin and Ethereum has evolved into a Big Three that now firmly includes Solana. Network Overview 2024 Review The long-anticipated Firedancer client debuted on mainnet in a limited capacity this year with a lightweight version of the new software dubbed “Frankendancer. Developed by Jump Trading, Firedancer is a high-performance validator client for the Solana blockchain designed to enhance transaction processing speeds and scalability. It will be rolled out in a phased release, with this initial release supporting only changes at the networking layer. Currently, the runtime still depends on the existing Agave client, meaning that core client software bottlenecks will not be fully addressed until the complete Firedancer implementation is complete. Token Extensions, a component of a new SPL standard for Solana-based tokens, were released in Q1 to bring more configurability to developers.

Solana was mired with instability issues and frequent outages in the not-so-distant past. However, core changes to the protocol have dramatically improved network uptime. There was a 5-hour outage early this year in February and occasional bouts of congestion, but given the sheer volume of transactions and increase in application usage, the relative stability of the Solana network was impressive this year. Messari was early in Q2 2023 to call out Solana’s comeback. Our analysts regularly write about Solana, including here (token extensions), here (zk compression), and here (Firedancer). Also, read our most recent report, “What Are Markets Pricing Into Solana’s Fee Growth.” 2025 Outlook The full Firedancer implementation is slated for 2025, which should significantly enhance client diversity on the network. In theory, this added diversity will improve both liveness and security by reducing reliance on a single client codebase. However, it’s possible that the immediate performance gains may be muted if other client implementations remain a bottleneck, delaying Firedancer’s full impact until other clients can evolve and become more performant. Looking ahead, the first Solana L2s are expected to launch next year. Their performance in real- world conditions will be closely watched, as it could influence Solana’s engineering roadmap and push development more aggressively toward Network Extensions. In subsequent chapters, we discuss these emerging trends—particularly how applications are shifting toward vertical integration via rolling their own L2s.

{"text": "Crypto Theses 2025 One of the most significant emerging trends in the latter half of this year was the integration of AI into the crypto ecosystem, particularly through AI agents. While we dedicate an entire chapter to the intersection of AI and crypto, it's important to note that some of the first-mover agentic AI applications are built on Solana, like ai16z, which has become one of the most trend-worthy repos on all of Github. The Solana ecosystem is not just embracing the intersection of AI and crypto; it’s pioneering it. TradFi Interest In TradFi circles, conversations about crypto increasingly include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and now Solana. Shortly after the US presidential election, a flurry of SOL spot ETF filings from VanEck, Bitwise, and 21Shares indicated a growing demand for ETF wrappers over the SOL asset. While Bitcoin is often viewed as digital gold and Ethereum as the established smart contract platform with compelling tokenomics, Solana is carving out a differentiated value proposition as the most performant crypto platform with remarkable momentum. Ethereum ETF inflows have accelerated as we close out 2024, signaling increased confidence in non-BTC-related financial products. If this trend continues, investors are likely to seek exposure to \"tech plays\" in the space, with Solana emerging as the fastest horse. A spot Solana ETF going live in the next year or two feels inevitable, and a more laissez-faire regulatory landscape may create the perfect storm for an explosive second leg in Solana’s narrative, fueled by pent-up institutional interest. Increased Competition While Solana has established a substantial lead in the high-throughput, general-purpose smart contract space, credible competitors are gaining momentum. Sui and Aptos have had strong years, and an entirely new crop of Layer 1 blockchains (like Monad, Berachain, and Sonic) is expected to emerge next year, which we discuss later in the report. Additionally, L2 solutions on Ethereum are picking up momentum, particularly in verticals poised for growth in the coming year, such as a resurging DeFi, AI agents, and consumer applications, led by platforms like Base and a host of upstart L2s. Parting Thoughts Solana was undoubtedly the top L1 not named Bitcoin this year. Importantly, Solana capitalized on three of the biggest narratives over the past year: memecoin trading, DePIN, and AI agents. With success comes increased competition, but the onus is on newcomers to carve out their own niches. Solana is uniquely positioned heading into 2025 as its primary competitor, Ethereum, grapples with an identity crisis, and upstart L1s still have work to do to match Solana’s distribution, robust application ecosystem, and support from venture firms.

{"text": "Crypto Theses 2025 High-Performance General Purpose L1s 2024 Review This year, headlined by Ethereum's identity crisis and Solana’s remarkable growth, favorable conditions were created for last cycle’s rookies, Sui and Aptos. Both networks have surpassed the $1 billion Total Value Locked (TVL) milestone, signaling increasing developer and user confidence in exploring high-performance alternatives to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). While much of their ecosystem growth stems from their native DeFi ecosystems, both projects have focused heavily on advancing their consensus mechanisms—Sui with its Mysteciti upgrade and Aptos with its ambitious Raptr proposal. Heading into the new year, both protocols are building on strong momentum, setting the stage for a competitive battle for mindshare among the emerging Move VM-based chains. TON came roaring onto the scene out of relative obscurity, largely due to a surge in mobile games on the Telegram platform. While activity has died down substantially since the summer, TON arguably has the largest distribution funnel of any major L1 with direct integration of its Mini-apps in Telegram. In July, TON networks’ TVL peaked at over $700 million, primarily driven by its two largest decentralized exchanges (DEXs), STON.fi and DeDust. Additionally, TON’s GameFi sector was key in driving adoption, with projects like Notcoin accumulating over 40 million users and Hamster Kombat reportedly reaching 200 million users, enhancing both user engagement and TON’s token circulation. It’ll be worth watching to see if they can support applications that achieve real, lasting usage. Tron continues to be a formidable player in the payments space, with nearly $60 billion in stablecoins in circulation. In November, Tron's monthly stablecoin transfer volume exceeded $500 billion, leading the total fees paid on the network to double throughout the year.

Subscribers can read more about TON in “Evaluating The Open Network's Onboarding Thesis” and Tron’s stablecoin dominance in “The Stablecoin Leapfrog: How Emerging Markets are Bypassing Traditional Banking.” 2025 Outlook Next year, we’ll be watching Monad and Sonic as two of the general-purpose, high-throughput, “monolithic” L1 launches. Both have focused primarily on scaling the EVM to its theoretical limit and fundamentally challenge the notion that you need multiple chains to scale blockspace, as they target >10,000 TPS on the base layer and 1-second or less finality times. The technical differences between these two are beyond the scope of this report, but the chains boast impressive transaction throughput numbers, and both projects have amassed massive war chests ($225 million for Monad, ~$250 million in FTM tokens for Sonic) to court developers and bootstrap their application ecosystems. 73", "metadata": {"source_file": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "page_number": 73, "chunk_id": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025_p73_c1"}}

After raising $142 million across its Series A and Series B, more than 270 projects committed to supporting the network, showing incredible interest from developers and application teams. If you want to learn about Berachain and Proof of Liquidity, I recommend checking out our Berachain Tokenomics report that was released earlier this year. Performant general-purpose L1s have driven fees sufficiently low for the most popular use cases, and chains keep getting faster. From an end user perspective, these chains just work. Blockspace is abundant, and users respond by transacting more onchain while developers are empowered to shed the infrastructure constraints of previous cycles to build great products. Expect continued momentum for high throughput, general-purpose execution environments for consumer-facing use cases. Modular Building Blocks: Celestia and Data Availability Layers 2024 Review Virtually all of the demand for data availability (DA) on Celestia came from Ethereum rollups aiming to reduce transaction costs, leading to the notion that external DA layers are merely “alt-DA” for Ethereum–essentially commodities with limited pricing power. Coupled with a nearly $1 billion unlock allocated towards contributors and early backers, it was a sluggish year for Celestia on the surface. However, significant research breakthroughs and continued engineering progress solidified Celestia’s technical roadmap, with clear paths towards massive scale, lightweight verification, and a new interoperability standard known as Lazybridging that has the potential to unify the currently fragmented rollup ecosystem. The DA space became more competitive in 2024 as EigenDA, Avail, NEAR DA, and others began rollout strategies, each with varied architectural approaches and tradeoffs. Read more about NEAR DA in “State of NEAR Q3 2024.” 2025 Outlook We believe that cross-chain interoperability initiatives, like Celestia’s Lazybridging proposal and Avail’s Nexus ZK proof verification layer, have the potential to establish meaningful network effects for modular L1s in the back half of 2025. In particular, Celestia is on the precipice of becoming an ecosystem unto itself as applications decouple from more opinionated base layers for performance, customizability, and sovereignty. A lineup of projects like Astria, Forma, Hashflow’s xOS, SpiceNet, and Prism should bring a healthy dose of DeFi, supporting infrastructure, and consumer applications to the Celestia ecosystem next year. 74", "metadata": {"source_file": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "page_number": 74, "chunk_id": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025_p74_c1"}}
{"text": "Crypto Theses 2025 The success of Celestia and other modular L1s hinges on ecosystem development as their native ecosystems start building standalone ecosystems, moving beyond just DA to coordinating cross-chain activity and removing fragmentation bottlenecks across their respective L2s. Messari subscribers can read more about our outlook for Celestia in “Celestia – The Fault in Our Stars.“ Next Gen L2s 2024 Review Three key themes in the L2 category have materialized meaningfully this year. 1. Applications are outgrowing their L1s and opting to roll their own L2s Earlier this year, prominent Ethereum-based protocols began launching their own dedicated Layer-2 environments to overcome the limitations of traditional Layer-1 infrastructures. Frax, a stablecoin protocol on Ethereum, launched Fraxtal—an L2 designed to improve performance and generate additional revenue for FXS holders. More recently, Uniswap unveiled its long-anticipated Unichain, aiming to enhance scalability, consolidate fragmented liquidity, and potentially return MEV value to users and developers. Both Fraxtal and Unichain are built atop the Optimism tech stack, and OP Labs continues to flex its ecosystem development chops, as established organizations like Sony and Kraken have also announced plans to join the Superchain. Spinning up a custom L2 offers significant advantages to applications. By customizing transaction sequencing, applications can effectively mitigate MEV risks, ensuring fairer transaction ordering and reducing vulnerabilities to extractive attacks. This tailored approach also allows for optimized tokenomics, enabling applications to design economic models that align precisely with their unique requirements, enhancing value capture, and providing more control over transaction fees and incentives. Dedicated L2s also open up the design space for lower-level customization, allowing developers to implement bespoke features and infrastructure that cater specifically to their application's needs for improved performance and user experience. There are, however, downsides to rolling your own chain, like liquidity fragmentation, potential centralization concerns, and new infrastructure overhead. This trend isn’t limited to Ethereum-based projects. Solana-based platforms like Zeta Markets and Grass are also exploring the L2 landscape. Whether driven by technical considerations, economic incentives, or performance requirements, the decision for an application to run its own L2 rather than deploy on a standard smart contract chain is gaining traction. As more projects experiment with custom L2 solutions, the industry will be watching closely to understand the real-time implications of these evolving models. 75", "metadata": {"source_file": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "page_number": 75, "chunk_id": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025_p75_c1"}}
{"text": "Crypto Theses 2025 We covered the launch of Unichain here. 2. Next Gen Virtual Machines With non-EVM-based L1s proving their viability, it’s no surprise that L2s are following a similar path. This year's most notable launches were Eclipse and Movement—the first L2s within the Ethereum ecosystem to implement Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) and Move VM architectures, respectively. Both projects diverge significantly in their approach: Eclipse relies on a highly performant, centralized sequencer that could ultimately surpass Solana’s throughput at scale, while Movement is focused on seeding a multi-L2 environment powered by its own shared sequencing network. Although Eclipse and Movement are still in their infancy, intensified efforts will be made to persuade developers to abandon the EVM and embrace these emerging programming paradigms in the coming year. 3. The Design Space for L2s is Expanding Optimistic EVM L2s like Base, Arbitrum, and OP Mainnet continued to dominate across most metrics this year, maintaining their lead in adoption and activity. ZK rollups, led by StarkNet and zkSync, have trailed behind in adoption but achieved significant milestones. StarkNet is advancing plans to settle on both Ethereum and Bitcoin, while zkSync’s technology is gaining traction, with adoption from projects like Lens Protocol and Pudgy Penguins. The next generation of Layer 2s faces stiff competition, requiring compelling and differentiated value propositions to break through. This has led to new L2 designs that expand the possibilities of the rollup landscape. Consider MegaETH, a protocol that unapologetically embraces a centralized sequencer design in pursuit of unprecedented scale. With ambitions of 100,000+ TPS and millisecond-level block times, MegaETH aims to outperform decentralized L2s, which face inherent limitations due to consensus overhead and network constraints. MegaETH leverages Ethereum’s L1 security via EigenDA, forced transaction inclusion, and escape hatches to mitigate censorship concerns. At the opposite end of the spectrum, based rollups like Taiko focus on bringing rollups closer to the L1. Integrating directly with the L1 for sequencing brings based rollups closer to Ethereum in philosophy and architecture and sheds some of the “parasitic L2” concerns shared by critics of Ethereum’s roadmap.

If successful, expect to see other blue chip protocols follow suit and roll their own infrastructure. We also anticipate that alternative virtual machines, primarily the Solana and Move VMs, will continue to gain traction. Infrastructure is increasingly becoming multipolar, and while some fragmentation concerns will need to be solved, the allure of improved performance and security is compelling for developers and users. It is still too early to determine which L2 architectures are best positioned to win in the long run. However, the path toward a more seamless user experience currently favors high-throughput constructions like MegaETH. Based rollups may eventually catch up on the UX front, but in the short to medium term, high-throughput general-purpose architectures are better suited for the most popular, speculative applications like memecoin trading. Avalanche, Cosmos, and Appchains 2024 Review Standalone appchains have long nerd-sniped researchers and developers, but lasting success has been hard to come. Avalanche, however, continues to buck the trend as it is steadily growing into one of, if not the most, robust multichain ecosystem. Notably, DeFi Kingdoms and Dexalot, two L1s in the Avalanche ecosystem, surpassed the C-chain in total gas used and transaction costs back in September. The C-chain remains healthy, though, sporting over $1.5 billion in TVL and a stablecoin supply greater than $2 billion, both of which rank in the top 10 across all L1s according to DeFi Llama. Cosmos, on the other hand, did not have a great year. ATOM, the flagbearer for the Cosmos ecosystem, continued to struggle with an identity crisis. It has largely not served as a Schelling point asset in the Cosmos ecosystem, with questionable value accrual mechanisms and a gridlocked governance process when it comes to any sweeping changes on the Cosmos Hub. However, there are certainly pockets of positive developments, as evidenced by Noble, a stablecoin issuance platform for Cosmos, surpassing $1.5 billion in cumulative USDC issuance.

The team has raised $25 million, which is significantly less than the funds secured by the previously mentioned high-throughput, general-purpose L1s. However, Initia deserves recognition for its entirely different approach. The project aims to integrate the best aspects of the appchain thesis by combining a customizable yet opinionated technology stack with a more unified end user experience. Initia’s novel Vested Interest Program seeks to align incentives among all network participants, fostering a cohesive ecosystem. Launching as an L1, Initia will support between five and ten application- specific, interoperable L2 solutions when the mainnet goes live early next year. This strategic setup positions Initia to potentially lead the next wave of appchain adoption by building a truly cohesive ecosystem of scalable, interoperable chains. Other Infrastructure Trends Interoperability As the number of L1s and L2s continues to increase, interoperability is a key focus. While covering all the teams building interoperability solutions in this report is impossible, we’ll highlight a few key players in this space. Optimism’s Superchain is positioning to be the largest “rollup cluster” on Ethereum, with Coinbase, Kraken, Sony, Uniswap, and others launching L2s on their network. In August, the team shared its plans to improve the cross-chain experience for users, which include a new message-passing protocol, an updated ERC20 standard (dubbed SuperchainERC20), and uniform security for any Superchain L2s via a shared proof system. Enhanced interoperability within the Superchain is key to unlocking network effects and a symbiotic relationship between all chains in the OP ecosystem. 78", "metadata": {"source_file": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "page_number": 78, "chunk_id": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025_p78_c1"}}

We did a deep dive on intents in a report, Following the Value Flow in the Intents Stack, so I won’t rehash all the details here, but we expect cross-chain intents to play a key role in the interoperability landscape next year. Espresso and other shared sequencing infrastructure are another approach to improving composability across L2s. Shared sequencers can enable atomic and trust-minimized cross- rollup communication, meaning that transactions can be executed across different rollups simultaneously, improving the overall interoperability and user experience of fragmented rollups. There is a question about incentives for chains to join a shared sequencer network, as centralized sequencing is a profitable endeavor, and cross-chain MEV is potentially lucrative as more financial activity moves to L2s, but on its technical merits, shared sequencing is certainly an important tool in the interoperability toolkit. Omni Network is a Layer-1 blockchain secured by restaked ETH through Eigenlayer. The protocol provides a unified platform for users and developers to interact with the Ethereum rollup ecosystem. It allows users to access various Ethereum rollups from a single platform while developers can create decentralized applications that work across all Ethereum rollups. Omni is currently operating on “private mainnet” and should go live in production sometime in 2025. Chain Abstraction Chain abstraction is shaping up to be one of the biggest trends to watch in the coming year. It will tackle frustrations that both developers and users face onchain. For developers, choosing which chains to deploy ties their app's success to the fate of the underlying infrastructure—a risky gamble. For users, juggling funds across multiple chains and paying gas in different tokens creates unnecessary friction. Chain abstraction isn’t a single technology but rather a combination of bridges, messaging platforms, intent infrastructure, proof aggregators, shared sequencers, and more.

Base and Solana - Valuable Real Estate The two blockchains that have exhibited the most trading related growth this year have been Solana and Base. While Solana has seen trading volumes congregate in memecoins, Base has seen a ton of activity for trading majors like spot ETH and Coinbase’s cbBTC. However, we believe that both chains are largely finding success as a result of the same drivers, with those being low transaction costs and user-centric product-led roadmaps. This means that any new and emerging “metas” can spurn volumes on either chain going forward, a pattern that has already begun to play out with AI agent related tokens. We continue to see a path forward for Solana and Base DEXs to grow share relative to DEXs on other chains. Vertical Integration vs. Composability 2024 brought us new debates around whether DEXs should prioritize vertical integration or composability within a broader network. On one end, protocols like Hyperliquid and Uniswap have transitioned towards owning their own infrastructure in order to configure network characteristics to benefit their applications. On the other end, leading venture funds like Multicoin have backed Solana native applications like Drift for their proximity and composability to the rest of the growing Solana ecosystem. Both perspectives have merits, and we believe that both approaches present valid roadmaps for growth, as execution focused high value traders gravitate towards vertically integrated protocols while a wider set of less sophisticated onchain participants choose composability. Prediction Markets in a Post-Election World Polymarket has found product-market fit this year as an onchain venue for atypical trading markets, such as politics and pop culture. That being said, with the end of the 2024 presidential election, open interest on the platform has already undergone a steep contraction.

{"text": "Crypto Theses 2025 The adoption of these products was driven largely by interest rate dynamics. For much of 2022 and early 2023, the negative spread between onchain yields (e.g., from USDC lending) and offchain U.S. Treasury yields made tokenized treasuries an attractive option for crypto users seeking better returns. Even as this spread turned positive, new offerings like BlackRock's BUIDL fund sustained growth. However, the benefits of tokenized treasuries are not universally accessible. Regulatory requirements limit these products primarily to accredited investors, reducing their composability with DeFi protocols and leaving the user base relatively narrow. For example, BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, with $500 million AUM, serves only 17 holders. Despite their limitations, tokenized treasuries played a key role in bridging traditional finance and crypto during a high-interest-rate environment. Yet this reliance on favorable macro conditions raises questions about the sector’s resilience as rates normalize. Looking Ahead: Predictions for 2025 and Beyond As interest rates decline, tokenized treasuries are expected to face headwinds, with growth likely slowing as onchain yields become more competitive. However, RWAs have significant opportunities to expand their impact and attract new capital: Idle Onchain Capital One immediate growth avenue lies in targeting the roughly $800 million in idle stablecoins held by DAO treasuries and the estimated $1-2 billion in venture fund capital sitting unallocated. Tokenized treasuries could offer these holders a low-risk yield, particularly for protocols seeking treasury management solutions.

Platforms like Bybit have already integrated yield-bearing collateral, offering a glimpse into this model’s potential.

Exporting Onchain Yields Beyond capturing idle capital, RWAs could flip the narrative, exporting crypto yields to traditional investors. Onchain yields—driven by crypto-specific market dynamics rather than macro interest rates—offer uncorrelated, attractive returns for traditional finance. Early movers like Superstate and Hashnote are already launching products that combine onchain yield opportunities with familiar structures, such as Superstate’s Carry Trade Fund, which mixes crypto cash-and-carry trades with U.S. Treasuries. Moving Further Out the Risk Curve As tokenized treasuries face diminishing appeal, some protocols may explore higher-yielding products, such as tokenized private credit.

{"text": "Crypto Theses 2025 Evolving Yield Strategies: Points Farming and Yield Trading 2024 in Review: A new way to bootstrap 2024 saw the continuation of the late 2023 trend of protocols without a token launching points programs. These programs act as an incentive mechanism for users to utilize a protocol under the assumption that the points would be converted to tokens at the token generation event. Points provided a more flexible way for protocols to experiment with incentive mechanisms. This allowed them to identify which approaches led to the best user engagement. Instead of adjusting incentives on the fly during an ongoing token distribution, protocols could retroactively reward users with tokens based on their participation. This strategy was adopted by notable protocols including EigenLayer, Ethena, and more recently, Hyperliquid. While point based incentives created an alternative token distribution path for protocols it also created a new asset, the points themselves, for markets to trade and speculate on, fuelling two new use cases: points markets, and yield trading. Points Markets In 2024, points marketplaces, led by Whales Market, gained traction in crypto. Designed to help protocols track and reward user activity, points evolved into speculative assets traded over the counter. Whales Market, built on Solana, facilitated this trade, allowing users to monetize points and pre-airdrop allocations. Early adoption fueled growth, but activity dropped sharply after the Jupiter airdrop in January. This decline exposed the platform’s reliance on hype cycles tied to specific events. While some trading shifted to Ethereum, the reduction in Solana volumes raised concerns about the sustainability of the points trading model. The development of a secondary market for points also created challenges for protocols relying 93", "metadata": {"source_file": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "page_number": 93, "chunk_id": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025_p93_c1"}}
{"text": "Crypto Theses 2025 on them. By detaching points from their role as engagement metrics, marketplaces like Whales risked reducing their usefulness for protocols. This issue, combined with inefficiencies in pricing and competition from other trading mechanisms, suggested potential long-term obstacles. While the marketplace highlighted demand for trading non-tokenized assets, its dependence on speculative behavior and the declining utility of points programs underscored the fragility of the model, both for Whales Market and points trading as a whole. Yield Trading Pendle established itself as a key platform for interest rate derivatives in 2024, driven by its integration with liquid restaking tokens (LRTs) and its connection to EigenLayer’s restaking points program. By enabling users to separate principal and yield from liquid staking tokens and LRTs, Pendle facilitated the trading of EigenLayer points, creating a secondary market for these speculative incentives. EigenLayer, with $1.8 billion in ETH deposits, attracted attention through its points-based incentive program. Collaborations with protocols like ether.fi and Kelp DAO allowed Pendle users to trade EigenLayer’s anticipated airdrop value via yield tokens (YTs). Within three weeks of launching LRT-based pools, Pendle saw $200 million in TVL from these integrations, contributing to 40% of its total TVL by the end of the year. Yield tokens for LRTs offered a fixed APY of approximately 30%, higher than standard ETH staking rewards. This appeal drew participation from users seeking predictable yields and those trading on the speculative potential of EigenLayer’s eventual airdrop. Pendle’s integration of LRTs provided a mechanism for efficiently trading restaking points and accessing additional yield opportunities. Looking Ahead: Predictions for 2025 and Beyond We expect points to remain central for protocols aiming to bootstrap user adoption through token distributions, providing momentum for both marketplaces and yield trading protocols. Future points programs will likely undergo adjustments as protocols refine their approaches to aligning incentives with desired user behaviors while nurturing communities of early adopters. These refinements will play a key role in maintaining the effectiveness of points as a strategic tool. For points marketplaces, liquidity and settlement present significant challenges and opportunities. Thinly traded order books currently offer only limited insights into price discovery, underscoring the need for improved liquidity. Protocols will likely need to implement stronger incentives to attract liquidity from key participants. However, liquidity growth may be constrained by unresolved settlement issues, as many protocols lack straightforward mechanisms to guarantee a seamless transaction experience. Addressing these gaps will be essential for market maturation. 94", "metadata": {"source_file": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "page_number": 94, "chunk_id": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025_p94_c1"}}
{"text": "Crypto Theses 2025 For yield protocols like Pendle, growth will depend on broader opportunities in yield farming. This includes the emergence of large protocols distributing points to users who deposit assets, as well as additional yield opportunities such as the potential for increased basis trading on platforms like Ethena amid rising open interest. While points programs have been the primary catalyst for the adoption of yield trading protocols, other drivers, such as innovations in staking and trading dynamics, could further expand their use cases. Nonetheless, points programs are likely to remain a central focus, sustaining their role as a core use case for yield trading protocols. The Road Ahead: Optimizing Points and Yield Protocols As we move into 2025, the role of points as both an incentive mechanism and a tradable asset will continue to evolve. Protocols are likely to refine their points programs, aligning incentives more effectively with user behavior while fostering early adopter communities.

The Battle Against MEV: Innovations in Extraction and Mitigation 2024 in Review: Progress in MEV Mitigation through Intent-Based Systems The past year saw a focused push toward addressing Maximal Extractable Value (MEV), a persistent inefficiency in DeFi.

{"text": "Crypto Theses 2025 MEV Mitigation: Laying the Groundwork MEV, or maximum extractable value, has long been a challenge in DeFi, driven by practices like arbitrage, front-running, and sandwich attacks. However, in 2024, a new wave of solutions emerged, focused on redistributing MEV back to users and liquidity providers (LPs). Central to this shift are intent-based systems, which have played a pivotal role in reducing MEV for end users. Protocols like CoW Swap and UniswapX introduced intent-centric MEV auctions, where market makers (or solvers) bid for the right to execute user transactions. These systems transform MEV opportunities into a competitive marketplace, redistributing value from validators and searchers to users and LPs while ensuring a more balanced allocation of transaction benefits. By abstracting the transaction path, intent-based designs not only improve execution but also protect users from exploitative behaviors like sandwich attacks. This approach optimizes pricing, reduces MEV extraction, and fosters a more user-friendly trading environment. While these intent-centric solutions make a better trading experience for users, they remain siloed within individual protocols. This limits their full potential and highlights the need for greater interoperability across DeFi platforms. Other Benefits of Intent-Based Systems Beyond MEV mitigation, intent-based systems offer additional advantages. By aggregating liquidity across onchain and offchain venues, they improve access to global liquidity, optimize cross-chain interactions, and simplify user workflows.

Platforms like Flashbots’ SUAVE and Anoma are expected to launch decentralized intent marketplaces where users’ intents can be broadcast to a network of solvers. These marketplaces aim to establish open, permissionless auctions that foster competitive MEV mitigation. Decentralized order-flow auctions will promote transparency by reducing reliance on centralized auctions, ensuring fair access for solvers, and maximizing the value returned to users. Additionally, by aggregating intents across multiple protocols and chains, these platforms will attract a broader network of solvers, improving execution efficiency and optimizing MEV capture for users. Major platforms such as Uniswap and Balancer are likely to integrate intent-based MEV mitigation strategies on a larger scale. By embedding auction hooks and execution optimization directly into their systems, these protocols could set new benchmarks for redistributing MEV, potentially reshaping industry standards. However, challenges remain on the path toward decentralized intent architectures. Decentralizing auctions requires robust solutions to address issues like censorship and auction manipulation, ensuring fairness in the process. Additionally, as intent systems become more widespread, there is a risk of commoditization. Protocols will need to prioritize execution quality and speed to differentiate themselves in an increasingly competitive landscape. The Road Ahead: MEV Returns to the Users 2025 will mark a turning point for MEV mitigation, with intent-based systems becoming entrenched throughout DeFi. Despite ongoing challenges, intent-based applications present an opportunity to mitigate MEV while also enhancing the chain abstraction stack, a topic explored further in a later section. Cross-Chain Interoperability: Building Bridges in DeFi Chain abstraction has emerged as a critical framework to address the challenges of navigating a fragmented multichain ecosystem. While the concept has long been discussed, the past year has provided new clarity on its role in simplifying user experiences and aggregating liquidity across chains. As 2024 draws to a close, it’s an opportune moment to reflect on how the ecosystem has evolved and to consider its trajectory for the coming years.

{"text": "Crypto Theses 2025 2024 in Review: Progress in Unifying Cross-Chain Activity The multichain environment remains complex, with users often juggling multiple wallets, gas tokens, and bridges. Chain abstraction aims to reduce this friction by simplifying cross-chain interactions and consolidating liquidity. Over the past year, two key developments have driven advancements in the space: improvements in cross-chain user experiences and the rise of solver networks to address liquidity fragmentation. User Experience Improvements Messaging protocols have played a central role in simplifying cross-chain activity. By enabling chains to communicate state, these protocols allow users to interact seamlessly across chains without needing to transfer assets manually. For example, protocols like Radiant demonstrated how messaging can facilitate cross-chain lending, allowing users to lock collateral on Ethereum while borrowing assets on Solana—all without the need for additional bridging steps. Yet, adoption has been uneven. While messaging protocols enable more intuitive interactions, the complexity of deploying them across chains has limited their reach. Protocols like LayerZero gained traction, but broader adoption will require deeper integration with front-end applications. Liquidity Aggregation via Solver Networks Fragmented liquidity across chains remains a significant barrier. Solver networks emerged as a solution, acting as offchain market makers to optimize liquidity across venues. These networks enable intent-based transactions, where users express desired outcomes (e.g., swapping ETH for SOL) without specifying the exact execution path. Solvers identify the best routes to fulfill these intents, leveraging both onchain and offchain liquidity. Despite progress, challenges persist. Solvers rely heavily on messaging protocols for cross- chain value transfers, and the lack of standardization across protocols has slowed scaling efforts. Additionally, while solver networks addressed liquidity fragmentation for specific use cases like swaps and bridging, their application to broader multichain activities remains limited. Looking Forward: Predictions for 2025 and Beyond While chain abstraction has made strides, its near-term evolution will focus on refining user experiences and addressing liquidity gaps, rather than fully abstracting user decision-making.

{"text": "Crypto Theses 2025 1. Messaging Protocols Will Become Commoditized Messaging protocols have been instrumental in enabling cross-chain communication, but their B2B nature limits their ability to capture long-term value. Most applications require access to only a few key blockchains, reducing the potential for network effects. As a result, messaging protocols will compete on price and security guarantees, with value shifting to front-end applications and solver networks. 2. Bridging Demand Will Decline as Applications Integrate Cross-Chain Messaging Today, bridging dominates cross-chain activity, but this is expected to change. As more applications natively support cross-chain messaging, users will no longer need to bridge assets manually for many use cases. For example, lending protocols could allow users to lock collateral on one chain while borrowing on another, with messaging protocols managing the interaction. This evolution will reduce the proportion of transactions requiring traditional bridging, potentially slowing growth in the bridging sector. 3. Solvers Will Compete on Execution Efficiency Solver networks will remain vital for aggregating liquidity, but their success will depend on providing fast, cost-efficient execution paths. General-purpose solver networks capable of handling diverse user intents may emerge, but the current homogeneity in applications limits the need for complex intent fulfillment. As a result, solvers will focus on optimizing swaps, bridges, and simple lending interactions, competing primarily on price and speed. 4. Full User Decision-Making Abstraction Remains Distant Despite the long-term vision of chain abstraction removing user preferences for specific chains or applications, this remains a distant goal. In practice, users still show strong preferences for certain chains and applications, driven by token availability and the dominance of leading protocols. For instance, 90% of DEX volume is concentrated on just seven chains, highlighting the importance of chain-specific activity. Similarly, most 99", "metadata": {"source_file": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "page_number": 99, "chunk_id": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025_p99_c1"}}
{"text": "Crypto Theses 2025 lending and trading protocols exhibit minimal differentiation, reducing the need for users to outsource decision-making. The Road Ahead: Gradual Evolution, Not Revolution The chain abstraction landscape is maturing, but the immediate focus remains on improving usability and liquidity aggregation rather than achieving full abstraction of user preferences. Messaging protocols and solver networks will continue to be foundational, but their roles will shift as bridging becomes less central and messaging commoditizes. Meanwhile, front-end applications and solvers will emerge as key value drivers, leveraging seamless experiences and execution efficiency to attract users. While the long-term vision of chain abstraction involves removing the complexities of chain and application selection, the next few years will likely see incremental progress. Chains and applications remain integral to user preferences, driven by token availability and limited protocol differentiation. True abstraction will require broader token deployment and greater diversity in application design—milestones that remain further down the road. For now, the focus will remain on refining the multichain user experience and addressing liquidity fragmentation, setting the stage for deeper integration in the future. Wayfinder is an early indication of this end state. By combining application discovery and intent execution through a graph-based structure, Wayfinder leverages AI agents to simplify multichain interactions. These agents act on behalf of users to identify and traverse optimal paths for tasks like token swaps or bridging, showcasing how intuitive systems can begin to close the gap between the current landscape and the fully abstracted vision. Such protocols highlight the incremental but critical steps being taken to transform multichain experiences, reducing friction and enhancing user accessibility. 100", "metadata": {"source_file": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "page_number": 100, "chunk_id": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025_p100_c1"}}

{"text": "Crypto Theses 2025 Looking Back: Key Trends in 2024 AI x Crypto was undoubtedly one of the hottest new narratives of the year, coming to fruition after the surge in broader interest in large language models (LLMs) and general intelligence AI. The teams and tokens behind protocols looking to merge AI and crypto saw massive amounts of capital formation both in the private markets and the public markets. In the private markets, over $1 billion was invested in the AI x Crypto sector in 2024. In the public markets, the total market cap of AI related protocols grew from ~ $5 billion in October of 2023 to over $60 billion as of early December. Crypto’s new leading AI protocol, Bittensor, launched and grew to over $4 billion in circulating market cap across the same time frame. Messari began covering the emerging sector in March of 2023, and as the space has evolved, we most recently categorized the majority of AI related crypto projects into the following categories: • Decentralized Compute Networks: Networks of GPUs that can be leveraged to train, fine- tune, or inference models. • Coordination Platforms: Platforms that incentivize model development, such as what Bittensor provides, or specialized inference settings (e.g., zkML), such as what Modulus is developing. • AI Tools and Services: Projects that operate or build services for AI models and agents to use, often situated within a shared marketplace that AI agents or developers can pay to access. • Applications: Applications where underlying AI models are productized for consumer or enterprise usage, akin to a ChatGPT. We highlight some of the more noteworthy trends in the AI x Crypto sector this year below: Decentralized Model Training The current landscape of machine learning (ML) model training is characterized by significant investments in GPU infrastructure, driven by the need to build larger and more capable models. The traditional centralized model training paradigm relies heavily on co-located, tightly coupled GPU resources to handle the massive computational demands of training state-of-the-art trillion parameter models, such as GPT-4. However, researchers looking to train their own models without access to the balance sheets of leading tech companies require lower CAPEX and more distributed alternatives. Numerous DePIN teams like Akash and IO.net have positioned themselves as providers of decentralized compute, aiming to attract GPU suppliers ranging from consumer-grade GPUs like NVIDIA’s 3090 and 4090 to high-end ML-specific GPUs such as the A100 and H100. These decentralized networks allow customers to rent GPU compute at a lower cost without needing to warehouse the resources in a centralized location.

Bittensor stands out as an early solution, providing a framework for decentralized AI model development through an ecosystem of subnets, each with specific AI objectives. Its incentive-based structure, driven by TAO token emissions, encourages developers and miners to work collaboratively towards training and refining AI models, with validators assessing model performance. In short, Bittensor is a conglomerate backer of open- source AI teams that fosters rapid experimentation and innovation, providing an alternative to the traditional top-down approach of centralized AI labs. So far, Bittensor has created a decentralized environment where diverse AI applications can thrive, benefiting from collective marketing and token emissions.

The all-encompassing offering of the Bittensor network has earned TAO the leading valuation in the AI x Crypto sector by FDV at ~$12 billion, and the protocol is colloquially referred to as the “Bitcoin of AI”. Despite its market cap, many remain dubious about the protocol’s structural issues. Some of TAO’s biggest criticisms throughout the year include: • Many of the network’s subnets have failed to produce viable products. • Emissions remain a problem considering the protocol does not earn revenue share from the successes of its own subnets. • Bittensor will struggle to both attract and retain top notch AI talent, considering how easily reputable AI founders are able to raise capital, and the lack of barriers to prevent the subnets that find their killer application from leaving the ecosystem. • Centralization in emissions decision making means that the top 64 validators are able to dictate incentives based on subjective criteria. • There are two scalability issues: the reliance on a single set of validators to allocate TAO emissions, which becomes impractical as subnets grow, and the lack of an in-protocol mechanism linking miner demand to subnet usage, risking rising expenses without corresponding revenue scaling. To mitigate some of these issues, Bittensor announced several foundational upcoming upgrades, which we will discuss in our forward looking section.

{"text": "Crypto Theses 2025 AI Agent Tools and Services: Navigating the Onchain Domain AI agents are autonomous programs designed to perform tasks on behalf of users, often within complex and evolving environments. In the blockchain space, these agents have become significant for their ability to navigate decentralized networks, perform transactions, and interact with various onchain applications. Think of agents as individual crypto users tasked to autonomously accomplish various goals from trading to yield farming. What sets agents apart from standard bots is their ability to learn best practices over time and make undefined decisions to accomplish predefined goals. With the excitement towards seeing AI agents flourish onchain, protocols are needed to provide much-needed servicing to both the agents and their developers. Two notable protocols currently working towards this vision are Autonolas and Wayfinder. Autonolas (OLAS) provides a framework for developers to create and deploy AI agents equipped with modular tools. These agents can be minted as NFTs, enabling others to reuse and build on their capabilities. Pre-built tools can provide specific functions—like prediction market analysis— that agents can use to autonomously complete tasks. This modular design allows developers to easily equip agents with the utility they need drastically reducing the time and effort needed to go-to-market with functional agents onchain. Wayfinder (PROMPT) aims to tackle the complexity of discovering and interacting with new blockchain applications by using AI agents to help users navigate the decentralized web. By mapping on-chain applications onto a structured graph, Wayfinder enables AI agents to automate actions, such as finding the optimal route for token swaps or managing transactions. This approach not only reduces the barriers for new agents but also makes blockchain interactions more efficient and accessible. The growing number of paths compounds the agents' capabilities over time, driving user adoption and fostering inviting and accessible access to autonomous blockchain interactions. The protocol is currently not live. Staking for the PROMPT token began in June, with the underlying staking asset being PRIME, the ecosystem token of GameFi developer Echelon Prime. As an initial demonstration of Wayfinder’s utility, Echelon will be utilizing Wayfinder’s graphing framework to deploy agents in its upcoming crypto gaming title, Parallel Colony. 105", "metadata": {"source_file": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "page_number": 105, "chunk_id": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025_p105_c1"}}

In 2024, the internet witnessed the bizarre rise of an AI-created religion and its associated memecoin, Goatseus Maximus (GOAT), which reached a market cap of over $1 billion in the span of a month. The phenomenon began with the Infinite Backrooms experiment, where two Claude Opus LLMs prompted to converse with each other spiraled into creating a satirical religion blending esoteric philosophy and internet memes. Andy Ayrey, the experiment's founder, later launched an AI agent on X (formerly Twitter), Terminal of Truths (ToT), trained on the experiment's logs and other internet culture sources. ToT developed a cult-like following, promoting the Goatse religion and eventually endorsing a community created GOAT token, which surged in value following its October launch. By combining AI-driven hype, meme culture, and crypto, the saga showcased the strange and unpredictable intersections of technology, culture, and finance. While GOAT represents a typical memecoin with no specific ties to any underlying protocol or technical roadmap, the token obtains its value through its relationship with ToT and its fascinating lore. ToT represents a foundational primitive when it comes to AI agents and their online cultural impact, amassing a following of over ~185k followers on X through its constant stream of humorous, abstract, and provocative tweets.

While sectors like DeFi have become established categories, AI x Crypto remains an emerging vertical with external tailwinds from the booming AI industry. The bull case for this space is that it will successfully connect two of the most explosive sets of technologies. Here’s what to watch for as the space evolves.

Similar questions can be asked about compute networks, like Akash, which has surpassed a $1 billion dollar valuation. How should a compute subnet on Bittensor, with more top-of-the-line GPUs, be valued relative to these existing compute networks? It may take time for the broader market to catch up, but those early to promising subnets will be rewarded. Ultimately, for Bittensor to reach its potential, it will need to attract top AI talent. This won’t be easy – AI research is fiercely competitive, and the space is filled with well-funded and established players. However, Bittensor has a unique angle that could pull in talent: its subnets show early signs of producing high-quality research.

Decentralized Model Training: A Stumble and a Pivot The dream of fully decentralized model training has existed for some time, and this year (some of) those dreams turned into reality. Two of the most prominent teams within the AI x Crypto space, Prime Intellect and Nous Research, both made unexpected contributions to the decentralized model training space. Over the summer, Prime Intellect published a paper describing a framework for decentralized model training. The results were promising, as Prime Intellect extended on Google’s DeepMind 108", "metadata": {"source_file": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "page_number": 108, "chunk_id": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025_p108_c1"}}

The team showed that, with the same compute budget, one can effectively match the performance of a centrally trained model, but leverage 4 geographically distributed clusters of H100s and communicate 125x less than the centralized setup. In addition, Prime Intellect scaled up the size of the decentralized trained model to 1.1B parameters, nearly doubling DeepMind’s original model size. They’ve continued their work and are now in the process of training an even larger 10B parameter model on their network. Nous Research also published a small paper describing their work towards developing a system for decentralized model training. The details were more sparse relative to the Prime Intellect publication, but the general research direction shows extremely positive and promising results. However, to rain a bit on the decentralized model training parade, we can’t forget reality—training state-of-the-art (SoTA) AI models in a decentralized way isn’t just a technical challenge; it’s also incredibly costly. Most of the top AI labs are already burning millions and, eventually, billions of dollars to build their SoTA models. So, it’s one thing to build a framework for decentralized model training and even gather (a portion) of the compute required for it; it’s another thing, though, to have a customer willing and able to pay to create a competitive, open-source SoTA model. With that in mind, it seems unlikely that any decentralized network will produce a frontier AI model in the coming year. What we’re more likely to see instead, is teams pivoting toward or doubling down on: • Fine-tuning open-source models; • Developing frameworks for running models locally; • Experimentation with new model architectures; • Experimentation with smaller, more specialized models. Rather than trying to compete with giants like OpenAI and Google by training massive foundational models, decentralized networks will likely shift focus to fine-tuning smaller, specialized models. This approach is both practical and potentially lucrative: smaller models require less computational power, and fine-tuning can create highly useful models for niche applications. Expect more experimentation in the realm of smaller and specialized models over the next year. These models, potentially designed to perform specific tasks rather than act as general- purpose AI, could find traction in a market that rewards quick experimentation, especially at the consumer application level. Decentralized AI may not be ready to take on the giants, but that doesn’t mean it won’t carve out its own market in the near term. By focusing on fine-tuning and smaller models, decentralized networks can create valuable tools and potentially foster ecosystems of innovation that larger players overlook. 109", "metadata": {"source_file": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "page_number": 109, "chunk_id": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025_p109_c1"}}
{"text": "Crypto Theses 2025 AI Agents and Memecoins: Ongoing Experimentation It is still early for the AI agents / memecoins category, but looking forward there are several attractive tailwinds: Onchain development will increase As we highlighted, while AI agents will not exist solely onchain, it is likely that most AI agents will prefer to be onchain. Crypto rails allow agents to seed wallets, transact, and send funds in a cost-effective, permissionless, and frictionless manner. On the other hand, using legacy financial rails comes with a restrictive amount of red tape. These methods would require agents and their developers to manage individual or corporate identities in order to interact with the banking system. Imagine how difficult it would be for Zerebro to make payments using Apple Pay. Thus, for developers interested in building agents that can perform financial actions autonomously, utilizing onchain infrastructure will be the most effective approach. It is encouraging to see that the most recent wave of AI x crypto agents seem to be affirming this thesis, with some of the examples we listed already using the blockchain as intended. Furthermore, the popularity and valuations of leading crypto AI agents and their associated tokens demonstrate crypto’s advantages when it comes to bootstrapping communities and attention. Growing token valuations can fund continued development and fuel social media engagement. For developers looking to make an impact and maximize their financial incentives, crypto remains a better playground for experimentation. We believe that the current agent landscape serves as a compelling case study for teams interested in pushing the boundaries of what AI agents can offer, and that talent density will continue to increase as more engineers take notice. Unlike other areas of AI, where the cutting edge occurs within traditional companies, the forefront of agent development is happening in crypto. Agent coins are more “dynamic” than memecoins In many cases, there are no direct financial links between an AI agent and its token. Instead, we prefer to view AI agent memecoins as tokenized expressions of fandom or as positions that bet on an agent’s ability to enhance its capabilities and capture greater mindshare. Traditional memecoin investors appreciate the \"static\" nature of their assets, as the absence of roadmaps eliminates execution risk. In contrast, the market for AI agents is more \"dynamic,\" as agents can evolve, improve their capabilities, and capture increasing mindshare over time. We believe that, in aggregate, as agent KOLs compete actively for attention on social media, this category will gain ground against \"static\" memecoins. However, as a result, investing in individual agent tokens introduces greater execution risk.

We note that the combined market cap of these assets remains a small fraction of even crypto x AI’s total valuation. Open Source vs Closed Source AI - Crypto Enters the Conversation A key narrative to watch will be the ongoing debate around open source vs. closed source AI models. Theoretically speaking, competitive AND open source technology has always been the holy grail for technologists and futurists alike. The reality for AI is that there are several structural limitations that currently prevent open source models from reaching product parity with centralized incumbents, and closed-source AI labs like OpenAI, Claude, and Google’s DeepMind continue to lead the development of cutting-edge AI models. Backed by major Web2 hyperscalers, these internal research divisions benefit from economies of scale, vast financial resources, and access to top industry talent. This combination has allowed closed-source systems to dominate the AI landscape, leaving open-source initiatives struggling to keep pace. Crypto will undoubtedly play a role in the development and usage of open source AI. In the summer, Sentient Labs raised a massive $85 million seed round to develop competitive open source AI on Polygon, joining other pioneering crypto-native projects like Bittensor. AI agents on X will lean towards using open source AI models like LLaMA, presenting a clear use case for open source models.

Originally developed by Chainlink’s Research Lab, zk-TLS leverages zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to verify Web2 credentials and data without exposing the underlying information. Key Use Cases: Identity Verification and Beyond 1. Onchain Identity Verification: ○ The primary application of zk-TLS lies in enabling the creation of onchain identities by verifying Web2 credentials while preserving user privacy. This opens the door to more robust decentralized identity systems, crucial for sectors like DePIN and Web3. 2. Vampire Attacks on Web2 Platforms: ○ zk-TLS has drawn significant attention for its potential to enable “vampire attacks”, a process where Web3 or DePIN networks bootstrap their ecosystems by onboarding users from existing Web2 platforms. ○ For instance, Nosh, a DePIN for food delivery, could use zk-TLS to \"vampire attack\" DoorDash. By verifying that DoorDash drivers have high ratings without revealing sensitive data, Nosh could onboard top-quality drivers to bootstrap its decentralized food delivery network. Drivers might want to switch to Nosh to gain a higher take rate from delivery fees–centralized platforms take an average of 30%- 40% of delivery revenue. If zk-TLS protocols successfully validate use cases like vampire attacks, the technology could see widespread adoption in DePIN and Web3 in 2025 and beyond. 139", "metadata": {"source_file": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "page_number": 139, "chunk_id": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025_p139_c1"}}

{"text": "Crypto Theses 2025 Messari covered TON in “Evaluating The Open Network's Onboarding Thesis.” Web2 Adoption In 2024, major Web2 intellectual properties made significant moves into the Web3 gaming space. Ragnarok launched its first venture on the Ronin network, while EVE Online introduced a new survival MMO on Redstone. Beyond IP, early signs of Web3 gaming adoption emerged among global enterprises, highlighted by Sony's announcement of its Layer 2 blockchain, Soneium, in August 2024. In the past, Web2 gaming entities have hesitated to embrace Web3 due to opposition from traditional gamers. However, this recent shift reflects a growing acknowledgment of the sector's legitimacy and a realization that the potential benefits outweigh the risks of alienating segments of the gaming community. This top-down acceptance sends a strong signal to gamers, highlighting the advantages of integrating Web3 technology into games. Over time, this is likely to influence gamers’ perceptions of the sector in a more favorable direction. On the player adoption front, the release of the long-awaited AAA game Off the Grid marked a breakthrough moment. The game successfully reached Web2 gamers through a strategic go-to- market campaign that heavily leveraged influencer marketing. At its peak, Off the Grid attracted over 150,000 concurrent Twitch viewers, driven by high-profile Web2 gaming streamers like Ninja, TimTheTatman, and Shroud. These influencers not only highlighted the game’s mechanics but also explained its Web3 components in a digestible way, helping to shift perceptions among traditional gamers. Play-to-Airdrop Throughout the year, many games have implemented a relatively new incentivization model called play-to-airdrop (P2A). P2A campaigns reward players with potential future token airdrops based on their in-game activities and engagement. This ideally results in higher retention as a larger cohort of users convert into regular players after the end of the incentive period. A few notable P2A campaigns throughout the year were Pirate Nation, Pixels, Fableborne, and Nyan Heroes. This method worked well for Pirate Nation. Their campaign attracted nearly 80,000 players, many of whom converted to DAUs. However, like most incentive mechanisms, the results of this method can become obscured by the presence of bots and farmers.

{"text": "Crypto Theses 2025 Looking Forward We believe gaming continues to have massive potential as an entry point into Web3. As prominent Web2 players enter the sector, the release of higher quality games and improving player sentiment are expected to create positive, compounding effects. These developments will make the advantages of Web3 gaming, such as asset ownership and permissionless global markets for trading assets, increasingly clear to traditional gamers. Additionally, we believe that play-to-airdrop will continue as a primary means of onboarding players to games. However, in recent months, we’ve seen the emergence of a new “pay-to- airdrop” strategy, where users are either required to pay to qualify or paid players receive a greater airdrop than non-paid players. The primary benefits of this model are reducing bots and predatory airdrop farmers. Farmers typically have no intention of converting into regular players and dump their tokens on the market after the campaign, negatively impacting legitimate players. While this model is still in the early stages, it is a promising method for mitigating the negative behavior seen in airdrop campaigns and could become a new standard in 2025. Finally, we believe that mobile adoption will be a defining trend of 2025. Mobile is the platform category with the highest adoption and most revenue generated globally. Web3 games that are early to mobile stand to capture significant mindshare by generating attention in a relatively benign competitive landscape with rising adoption. Additionally, as mobile technology continues to scale its capability of handling compute-intensive games, higher-quality mobile games will likely be released, attracting gamers seeking a AAA experience. Memecoins Love them or hate them, memecoins were undeniably one of the most prominent narratives of 2024. It all began as cult admiration for an adorable dog wif hat.

Throughout the year, memecoins consistently contributed 40–80% of Solana’s daily trading volume, capturing the lion’s share of total memecoin trading activity. Driven by the memecoin mania, Solana's weekly DEX volume occasionally surpassed that of Ethereum and, in recent months, has decisively outpaced it, accounting for up to 40% of total weekly DEX volume across all chains. Whether this trend is net positive or negative for Solana’s ecosystem is debatable.

Messari Research wrote about Moonshot in “Running Back Robinhood: The Rise of Moonshot.” Looking Forward In 2025, we anticipate Solana will continue to command the lion’s share of memecoin trading activity. The chain currently hosts the vast majority of trading volume, supported by infrastructure optimized for fast-paced speculative markets and consumer apps that streamline experiences for both developers and traders. However, as infrastructure becomes increasingly abstracted from the consumer experience, traders entering the space may soon be unaware of—or indifferent to—which chain they use. In this scenario, Solana’s dominance in memecoins will hinge on apps like Pump.fun maintaining a competitive edge over similar platforms on other high-throughput chains. The growing popularity of consumer apps like Moonshot reflects a shift in competitive dynamics from infrastructure development to UX enhancements. In previous cycles, consumer apps derived their edge from better core functionality due to the limitations of underdeveloped infrastructure. With many of these foundational challenges resolved, competition is shifting toward higher-order differentiators such as design, gamification, and personalization. As memecoins continue to serve as a key entry point for new crypto participants, consumer apps in this sector must meet the expectations of users accustomed to the simplicity of Web2 experiences. While this creates a more competitive landscape, those who excel in delivering seamless, engaging user experiences stand to capture outsized value as the layer closest to the end user. DeSoc & SocialFi The decentralized social sector experienced accelerating activity over the past year, building on the momentum from H2 2023 when Friend.tech onboarded over 800,000 users in just two months.

The sector also witnessed the rise of a transformative, developer-centric value proposition around front-end composability. Messari was early to DeSoc with our “Decentralized Social Protocol Map” report in February 2023. In “SocialFi: Exploring Social Business Model Innovation” we covered financialization of social activity. DeSoc Adoption Decentralized social (DeSoc) gained significant momentum in the first half of the year, with Farcaster and Lens capturing the most attention in the sector. Farcaster's DAUs climbed from just over 1,000 in January to more than 70,000 by the end of June, while Lens users grew from around 6,500 in January to just over 43,000 by early July. Despite strong growth in H1, the two platforms diverged in H2: Farcaster maintained steady retention with DAUs hovering between 40,000 and 50,000, whereas Lens experienced consistent declines, with current DAUs dropping to around 8,000. Although DeSoc is still in its early stages, these trends highlight the impact of differing go-to-market strategies. Farcaster has pursued a product-led approach, focusing on its flagship application, Warpcast, to build a centralized hub for users. In contrast, Lens has taken a developer-led approach, focusing solely on the protocol and relying on third-party developers to build applications. While both strategies have merits, Farcaster’s product-led approach has demonstrated greater success in driving user acquisition and retention so far. Unlocking Composability In previous years, the narrative around decentralized social primarily focused on user-centric value propositions such as data ownership and censorship resistance.

{"text": "Crypto Theses 2025 developer-centric value proposition emerged: front-end composability. Farcaster Frames Farcaster introduced Frames, a powerful tool that enables mini-apps to be embedded directly within Farcaster front-ends, providing developers with a seamless distribution channel that meets the user where they are. Frames allow users to perform both offchain and onchain actions, such as minting an NFT on Zora or placing a bet on Polymarket, directly from their social feed. Beyond simple one-click actions, developers can design Frames that guide users through multiple steps within the mini-app. With Web3 social graphs carrying over between apps, developers can further customize user flows based on individual onchain histories, creating highly personalized and dynamic experiences. Read more about Farcaster Frames in our report here. Blinks Following the launch of Frames, Solana responded with its own composability feature: Blinks. Unlike Frames, which are confined to the Farcaster protocol, Blinks extend this concept to Web2. Blinks transform Solana Actions—API calls enabling onchain interactions—into shareable links, which can be displayed on any web surface. Once users have configured a Solana-compatible wallet to transform these links into Blinks, they appear as a mini-app, similar to the UI of Frames. While Blinks represent one of the most innovative leaps in onchain distribution, their scalability ultimately depends on the widespread adoption of Solana-compatible wallets. Looking Forward We expect the open design space unlocked by front-end composability to continue evolving throughout 2025. While developers have already demonstrated innovative use cases, we believe the most creative and impactful implementations are yet to emerge. Additionally, the growing adoption of Solana-compatible wallets like Phantom will likely drive wider distribution and scalability for Blinks, enabling them to reach broader audiences. This has the potential to create a flywheel effect, by which greater adoption leads to more developers who seek to use it as a distribution channel, attracting more users to the benefits of their mini-apps. Additionally, we anticipate a significant acceleration in the proliferation of AI agents on DeSoc platforms. As demonstrated recently on Warpcast, AI agents are now capable of launching tokens, autonomously interacting with one another to achieve goals, participating in communities, and trading onchain. With tools for creating agents becoming increasingly accessible, human-to-agent and agent-to-agent interactions are poised to become a landmark feature of the decentralized social experience. 150", "metadata": {"source_file": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "page_number": 150, "chunk_id": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025_p150_c1"}}

Notable examples include: • Doodles partnering with McDonald's to release 100 million limited-edition McCafé holiday cups across the United States. • Pudgy Penguins expanding their Pudgy Toys line to major retailers, including their most recent launch at Target. • Claynosaurz collaborating with Gameloft to develop a free-to-play mobile game. Beyond IP expansion, projects have increasingly focused on building infrastructure to support broader ecosystem growth. The most prominent example is the Bored Ape Yacht Club’s launch of ApeChain mainnet in October, making it the first blockchain launched by an individual project. Similarly, Pudgy Penguins and Azuki are developing their own infrastructure, with Abstract Chain and AnimeChain, respectively, signaling a broader trend of ecosystem-focused innovation in the space. Consumer Applications As seen in many other maturing sectors, UX improvement has been a top priority among consumer apps. In 2024, Zora led the charge, releasing a mobile app that makes casual minting and trading NFTs similar to Web2 social apps like Instagram. Within this subsector, Zora has a significant lead over competitors like Rodeo and Moshicam, regularly accounting for over 90% of daily unique minters. In August, Zora, in partnership with Uniswap, introduced the \"ERC-20z\" token standard, an extension of ERC-1155, allowing NFTs to be traded similarly to ERC-20 tokens by wrapping and unwrapping them. This feature enables secondary markets to be created following the minting period set by the artist. This feature has tremendous benefits for both artists and collectors. Artists benefit from secondary royalties after their mint, while collectors who miss a mint during primary sales can still collect on the secondary market. Messari covered Zora early in our August 2023 report “Zora: Pushing Value to Creators.” Looking Forward Although price appreciation is always ideal for a sector, continuous innovation during less speculative periods indicates a healthy, maturing ecosystem. Removing rampant speculation allows assets to reach valuations more aligned with their fundamental value.

Ethena is able to collect fees off a portion of its yields. After topping shortly after launch, USDe supply is back on an upward trajectory as funding rates have increased. Ethena’s success has spawned other protocols like Elixir which are seeking to implement similar models with slight variations. Copilot Prompt: “Which new protocols are solving liquidity problems within the stablecoin space?” Meanwhile, Maker rebranded to SKY as it sought to reaccelerate growth in its stablecoin supply with its new stablecoin USDS. USDS’ collateralized-debt position model has become quite commonplace, but its capital inefficiency may be preventing it from growing substantially larger. Some protocols like USUAL are keeping it simple by merely replicating the Tether model onchain, paying out most of the yield the protocol receives from its treasury collateral in USUAL tokens to USD0 holders. Recent Messari reports covering stablecoins include “The Stablecoin Leapfrog: How Emerging Markets are Bypassing Traditional Banking” and “Experiments in Stablecoins”. Related reports include “Dude, Where's My (Stablecoin) Yield?”, “Ethena - The Goddess of Yield”, and “Analyst Discussion: Ethena.” The Budding PayFi Sector Evolving stablecoin rails have also allowed for new verticals to emerge that are having a real- world impact on businesses across continents. PayFi, short for Payment Financing, leverages blockchain and RWAs to finance onchain and offchain payment applications. Traditional payment financing solutions are often slow, requiring several business days to settle; expensive, with global remittance fees averaging 7%; and inaccessible to many due to geographical limitations, lack of documentation, or insufficient income. 167", "metadata": {"source_file": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "page_number": 167, "chunk_id": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025_p167_c1"}}
{"text": "Crypto Theses 2025 Huma Finance is one such protocol that aims to make use of stablecoins and crypto rails to create a PayFi network to speed up trade finance, DePIN financing, and cross-border payments. The protocol recently merged with Arf, a liquidity solution platform for cross-border payments. The combined entities are projected to hit $10 billion in payments-financing transactions next year, highlighting a massive use case of stablecoins like USDC to create more efficiency in the payments space. Global businesses can tap into highly-liquid stablecoin pools for short-term financing instead of tying up working capital waiting for funds to settle. Looking Ahead for CeFi As we noted in our stablecoin piece, Ethena’s supply will likely continue to expand as the bull market continues and funding rates remain elevated. However, yield-bearing stablecoins - whose yield is dependent on the market’s demand for leverage - likely aren’t taking significant share from Tether any time soon. Tether’s moat is incredibly strong, with millions of users both offchain and onchain who are accustomed to converting to USDT for trading, savings, and local currency swap purposes. Furthermore, with Howard Lutnick, Trump’s pick for Commerce Secretary, managing Tether’s assets at Cantor, it is possible the US will change its hostile stance towards 168", "metadata": {"source_file": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025.pdf", "page_number": 168, "chunk_id": "worldtokencongress_com_Messari-2025_p168_c1"}}

Stablecoin APIs - like those provided by Yellow Card - will power small businesses’ ability to accept stablecoins as payments across the globe. It’s also likely that Visa or Mastercard will either greatly expand stablecoin pilot programs or do an acquisition in the space. The advantages of leveraging crypto rails is too disruptive to traditional payment networks for them to ignore. On the exchange side, we will continue to see a melding of onchain and offchain services. Coinbase and Kraken will want to onboard as many people as possible to their L2s in 2025, and will likely provide incentives for doing so. As we mentioned in our election report, the new administration will allow exchanges to be looser with what assets they choose to list.
