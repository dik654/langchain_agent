{"text": "Course Modules : The students focus on hardware reverse engineering (RE). In the process of RE students understand existing technologies, functions, features, objects, components and systems. By carefully disassembling, observing, testing, analyzing and reporting, students can understand how something works and suggest ways it might be improved. This process requires careful observation, disassembly, documentation, analysis and reporting. Many times, the reverse engineering process is non-destructive. This means that the object or component can be reassembled and still function just as it did before it was taken apart. Throughout the reverse engineering project, the students are able to think of ways these objects could be improved. Is there some way it could function better? or manufactured less expensively? The students will use observations to make suggestions for improvement of the product. (28 Hours) Learning Topics: Reverse Engineering of Biotechnological/Biomedical- Devices/ prototypes.

In the process of RE students understand existing technologies, functions, features, objects, components and systems. By carefully disassembling, observing, testing, analyzing and reporting, students can understand how something works and suggest ways it might be improved. This process requires careful observation, disassembly, documentation, analysis and reporting. Many times, the reverse engineering process is non-destructive. This means that the object or component can be reassembled and still function just as it did before it was taken apart.

{"text": "occur among the system’s species, minerals, and gases; numerical solution for equilibrium state by determining a set of concentrations that simultaneously satisfy the mass action equation corresponding to each possible reaction.‘ – Solving for equilibrium state. The principal unknowns equations governing the equilibrium state of aqueous and solid environmental systems are the mass of water and concentrations of basic species, and moles of minerals in equilibrium. Many of these equations are often non-linear and hence cannot be solved using linear algebra. This chapter will focus on the special difficulties posed by the nonlinear forms of the governing equations and discuss how the Newton– Raphson method can be used in geochemical modeling to solve the equations rapidly and reliably. – Setting up a model. The basis in reaction modeling includes water, each mineral in the equilibrium system, and each gas of known fugacity, and certain aqueous species. The basis servers two main purposes, each chemical reaction in the model is written in terms of members of the basis set. This chapter discusses how an environmental system can be expressed in terms of chemical reactions and quantitative parameters in the model. – Equilibrium model of natural waters. This chapter will focus on constructing models of natural waters to predict processes like mineral dissolution, aqueous speciation of chemicals, minerals precipitation, gas dissolution and degassing, and pH of natural waters. – Redox disequilibrium. Many chemical reactions in the environment are redox (oxidation-reduction) reactions and are extremely important for contaminant mobilization. In this chapter, modeling of redox sensitive elements in the en- vironment (C, N, S, O, Fe, and other toxic metals) will be discussed. Inclusion of redox disequilibrium in chemical reaction modeling advances our abilities to predict behavior of contaminants in the environment. – Sorption and ion exchange. An important consideration in constructing en- vironmental chemical models, especially those applied to environmental prob- lems, is to account for the sorption of aqueous species onto sediment surfaces. Because of their large surface areas and high reactivities, many components of a sediment – especially clay minerals, zeolites, metal oxides and oxyhy- droxides, and organic matter – can sorb considerable masses. This chapter will focus on several simple models of ion sorption and exchange that can be applied within the context of a environmental reaction model. These models include distribution coefficients, Freundlich and Langmuir isotherms, and ion exchange theory. – Surface complexation. The sorption models presented in the previous chap- ter are, however, too simplistic to be incorporated into a geochemical model intended for use under general conditions, such as across a range in pH. This chapter discusses a theory of surface complexation to describe hydrolysis and the mineral surface, account for electrical charge there, and provide for mass balance on the sorbing sites. Several surface complexations models will be con- structed to predict the chemistry of natural water in equilibrium with minerals with specific reactive surface area.  Reaction Processes: This section overviews specific reaction processes such as 196", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_iitmandi_ac_in_iit_mandi_courses.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_iitmandi_ac_in_iit_mandi_courses.pdf", "page_number": 196, "chunk_id": "www_iitmandi_ac_in_iit_mandi_courses_p196_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241224124143+05'30'"}}

(12 hours). – Mass transfer. In this chapter we consider how to construct reactions paths that account for the effects of simple reactants, a name given to reactants that are added to or removed from a system at constant rates. – Polythermal reactions. This chapter will focus on constructing reaction models that varies over temperature. A temperature varies as a function of reaction progress, is numerically modeled, and activity of solutes, stability of minerals, fugacity of gases involved in the system is calculated as a function of temper- ature. – Geochemical buffers. Buffers are reactions that at least temporarily resist change to some aspect of fluid chemistry (e.g., pH buffers). This chapter focuses on constructing models of buffering reactions, both homogenous and heterogenous. – Kinetics of dissolution and precipitation. This chapter focuses on modeling environmental reactions to predict how much time it’d take to reach a cer- tain point along the reaction path, calculating relative rates of minerals in rocks, predicting chemistry of waters in equilibrium with certain rocks for a known amount of time, predicting future groundwater quality under known geochemical conditions, by incorporating reaction rate laws from the field of geochemical kinetics. – Redox kinetics. The subject of this chapter is modeling the rates at which redox reactions proceed within the aqueous solution, or when catalyzed on a mineral surface or by the action of an enzyme. – Microbial kinetics. This chapter focuses on how the microbial community cat- alyzes redox reactions, perhaps changing in size and composition as it does. The kinetics of such reactions are of special interest, because of the close rela- tionship between geochemical conditions and microbial ecology. The microbes promote reactions that change geochemical conditions, many times signifi- cantly, and the geochemistry controls the nature of the microbial community that can exist in a given environment.  Applied Reaction Modeling: This section overviews specific examples of model- ing environmental systems such as geothermal fluids, geothermometry, evaporation, sediment diagenesis, kinetics of water rock interaction, weathering, oxidation and reduction, waste injection wells, petroleum reservoirs, acid mine drainage, con- tamination and remediation, and microbial communities. These models of these (and other) environmental systems will be constructed throughout the duration of course using modeling programs like PHREEQC, Visual MINTEQ and Geo- chemist’s Workbench. The concepts learnt in previous chapters will be utilized in construction of these models. (8 hours). Text books: 1.

On completion of such a course, students should be able to ‘ analyse the asymptotic performance of algorithms - demonstrate their familiarity with major data structures, rule to manipulate those, and their canonical ap- plications - construct efficient algorithms for some common computer engineering design problems Further, as programming is an integral part of the CS education, in this course students should implement the data structures and algorithms they learn, compute the corresponding achievable performance (computation time, memory requirement, etc), and if possible compare the achievable performance with alternative designs. 4.4 CS 202: Data Structures and Algorithms Course Code: CS 202 Course Name: Data Structures and Algorithms L-T-P-C: 3-1-0-4 Prerequisites: IC-250 Programming and Data Structure Practicum Intended for: UG Distribution: Compulsory for CSE; CS elective for EE and ME Semester: 4th Approval: 5th, 9th, 12th Senates Coruse Contents  Complexity Analysis Time and Space complexity of algorithms, asymptotic anal- ysis, average and worst case analysis, asymptotic notation, importance of efficient algorithms, program performance measurement, data structures and algorithms.

{"text": "The proposed course follows the new CS curriculum design approach that strives to .cover in the above-mentioned six core courses all the fundamental concepts that a CS undergraduate student must know of. The course proposal attempts to include the fundamental topics in data structures and algorithms. The topics from the essential core of this course that must be . covered comprehensively, with lots of examples. practice exercises. and weekly programming labs. In the proposed contents. there are some topics that are marked advanced. These topics can be introduced depending on background and interests of the class and if the time permits. These and some other advanced topics should be covered in greater detail in advanced discipline electives. Obiective: After the students have gone throdgh a Course on disciet˜A© structureshwhe‘re they - learn the formal and abstract representations of data and its manipulation, a course on data structures and algorithms should teach the students concrete implementations and manipulations of such discrete structures and their use in design and analysis of non- trivial algorithms for a given computational task. On completion of such a course the students should be able to  analyze the asymptotic performance of algorithm  demonstrate their familiarity with major data structures rules to manipulate those, and their canonical applications  construct efficient algorithms for some common computer engineering design prob- lems Further, as programming is an integral part of the CS education, in this course the students should implement the data structures and algorithms they learn, compute the corresponding achievable performance (computation time, mem- ory requirement, etc), and if possible compare the achievable performance among alternative designs and implementations. Syllabus:  Complexity Analysis: (2 hours) Time and Space complexity of algorithms asymp- totic analysis, average and worst , case analysis asymptotic notation, importance of efficient algorithms program performance measurement. data structures and algorithms.  Stacks and Queues: (4 hours) ADT, sequential and linked implementations, representative applications. towers of Hanoi parenthesis matching, finding path In a maze.  Lists: (6 hours) ADT, sequential and linked representations, comparison of inser- tion, deletion and search operations for sequential and linked lists, list and chain classes, doubly Iinked lists, circular lists applications of lists In bin sort radix sort sparse tables.

[8 Lectures] Tutorials and assignments This course involves hands-on practice with writing different program analyses, imple- menting the techniques for efficiency, and learning various associated tools and language features. The classes wi ll teach the theory, and tutorials would train the students on the various skill-sets required to finish take home programming assignments. lt may be noted that as the coure covers several recent topics related to designing analyses that are precise-yet-efficient, the classes will use one or two important analyses as running examples (examples being alias analysis and pointer analysis for resolving virtual calls). Hence, another aim of the tutorial hours would be to help students imbibe the concepts learnt by making them write specifications of different analyses and optimization strategies. The take-home assignments will be based on implementing and understanding (a) intra- and inter procedural analyses; (b) strategies for imparting efficiency; (c) examples of handli ng tricky language features; and (d) non-trivial applications such as parallelization, refactorinp and security.

This ensures that C1 acts as a short circuit at all frequencies of interest. – (c) Plot —Vout/Vin— as a function of frequency for several values of C2 , e.g., 1 uF, 1 nF, and 1 pF. Determine the value of C2 such that the gain of the circuit at 10 MHz is only 2% below its maximum (i.e., for C2 = 1uF). – (d) With the proper value of C2 found in (c), determine the input impedance of the circuit at 10 MHz.

Research Study is designed to provide credit for field research, survey of literature leading to problem identification and extended knowledge in a focused field of study. The topic can be from academic or industrial research fields in the domain of VLSI. Objectives: (based action verbs at appropriate levels of Bloom’s Taxonomy): 1. Understand in details a particular area of research through contemporary publica- tions in that area. 2. Analyze the flow of research in a particular direction. 3. Identify the gap in that area. 4. Formulate a problem to identify that gap. 5. Propose an initial solution for the problem formulated. Methodology guidelines: 1. A student enrolled in M.Tech (VLSI) programme has to register for 3 credits of research studies during winter break after 1st semester. The credits earned through the research study will be added to the credits earned during the 2nd semester. 2. A student may be given the option to choose the broad area of Research Study (academic or industrial research), viz. Device Physics, Fabrication Technology, Circuit Design or Systems, based on which advisor(s) may be allotted to the student. 3. The topic chosen by student has to be approved by the faculty advisor. 4. The role of the advisor(s) is to assist the student during the research study. 5. It is expected that the student will meet the advisor at least once in a week. 6.

{"text": "7. The course will culminate with a seminar being presented at the end of winter break. 8. The seminar will be evaluated by a committee of four members involving faculty advisor (or nominee), advisor for the research study, two experts in that area from the faculty members of IIT Mandi. 9. The seminar is supposed to test presentation skills, clarity of problem, quality of slides being prepared and question-answer session at the end of seminar. 10. The seminar can be an open seminar, although the decision of the four member committee will be final. 11. The student is expected to put in an effort of 30 hours per week for two and half months from start of winter break to its end. 12. In events of a dispute between the student and advisor, the matter has to be settled in consultation with faculty advisor which in exceptional cases may go to course coordinator, Chairperson (SCEE) or Dean (Academics). 13. The advisor reserves the right to reject a student with sufficient reasons if a student fails to deliver up to the expectations of the advisor. In such a case, a student will have to find out his advisor on his own. However, the student will not be given any extra time to work out the new research study. 14. Any intellectual property (IP) generated out of an independent study is subjected to the IP regulations of IIT Mandi regarding sharing and ownership of IP rights. 7.124 EE 677 (3) Analog Circuit Design Approval: 2nd Senate; OTA Course Outline:  Review of integratedcircuit deviCecharacteristics& models  Review of elementary l transistoramplifiers 0 Twotransistoramplifiers  Current Mirrors, active loads  OutputStages  Operational Amplifiers  Frequency Response of IntegratedCircuits  Feedbacktechniques for IntegratedCircuits  Frequency Response & Stability of FeedbackAmplifiers  Differential Operational Amplifiers  Voltage and CurrentReferences (optional)  Review of the practical application of an OPAMP in e.g. filter  Other-Topics: Noise, non-linearity, mismatch, MOS vs Bipolar 641", "metadata": {"source_file": "www_iitmandi_ac_in_iit_mandi_courses.pdf", "source_full_path": "/home/filadmin/deepseek-RAG/data/downloaded_depin_pdfs/www_iitmandi_ac_in_iit_mandi_courses.pdf", "page_number": 641, "chunk_id": "www_iitmandi_ac_in_iit_mandi_courses_p641_c1", "creationDate": "D:20241224124143+05'30'"}}

{"text": "Laboratory/practical/tutorial Modules: Lecture hours are to be used for interactive discussion, placing the proposals about the topics at hand and motivating students to reflect, explore and verify them for devel- oping a holistic view so that basis for professional ethics can be established. Tutorial hours are to be used for practice sessions. While analyzing and discussing the topic, the instructor’s role is in pointing to essential elements to help in sorting them out from the surface elements. In other words, help the students explore the important or crit- ical elements. In the discussions, particularly during practice sessions (tutorials), the instructor encourages the student to connect with one’s own self and do self-observation, self-reflection and self-exploration. Scenarios may be used to initiate discussion. Ob- servations and their analyses are shared and discussed among all students, in a group sitting. Indicative plan of fourteen tutorials is as follows: Differentiating the notions of Preconditioning, Sensation and Natural Acceptance; Notions of Happiness; Case study of cunent economic activities and associated expectations of humans through the short video story of stuff’; Self-awareness through the list and analysis of individuals desires; Self-awareness and individuals role in ensuring the healthy condition of the body; Self- assessment of our status of prosperity; Appreciation of impact of individual behaviors on others through short movie Right Here Right Now ; Observing the feeling of gratitude; Discussion through short movie Economics of Happiness for understanding the role in lo- calization and globalization; Discussion through short movie Swaraj in Hiware Bazar for appreciating the possibility of transformation through relationship; Discussion through short movie An inconvenient truth for understanding the role of humans for mitigation of global warming; Discussion on the role of students for improving the status of justice in the institute and asking them to make a framework; Discussion on role of students for improving the economic sustainability of the institute; Discussion on role of students in reducing the carbon emissions impact of the institute; Differentiating the internal and external sources of happiness.

Stu- dents will also study the institutional framework as well as living conditions of humans across distinctive historical periods. Besides, they will investigate the im- pact of modern life in its various forms on the mind, on marriage, on family and its breakdown and of its significance for the future. They will attempt to comprehend diverse levels of stress in modern life and the solutions attempted, also economic factors and their psycho-social impact. Field trips to various tribal communities in Himachal Pradesh complement students understanding.  Political Science: Why does Aristotle describe Politics as the Master Science?

Communicative Competence Presents students three different choices:  Basic Communication Skills Every word we utter tells others what we really are. The course makes you aware of the need to present yourself to others exactly the way you would like them to perceive you.  Public Speaking and Debating Skills How can you win over the hearts and minds of others in speech? How do you structure an argument to persuade others to accept it? The course introduces you to the basic principles of the art of effective speaking.  Policy Analysis and Advocacy Skills Our public life, be it economics or the environment, is influenced by policies made by various advisory and regulatory bodies to the government. In the business world, corporate concerns too have their own policies. How does one examine the deep implications of these policies? How does one go about framing policies, say science and technology policies, for sustainable development? 12.51 HS 363: Post-war Germany: A Literary Perspective Course Code: HS 363 Course Name: Post-war Germany: A Literary Perspective L-T-P-C: 3-0-0-3 Students intended for: B.Tech.

The argument this course essentially tries to drive home is that social change in Indian context is no single narrative; it has always been plural in character and diverse in its scope and composition. Through concepts, theoretical frameworks, perspectives, styles of protest and critical events of dissent, it predominantly aims to offer students a comprehensive understanding on plural and diverse interpretations of the Idea of India, both historically and today, with a special reference to social movements in modern India.

{"text": "Semester: Summer session (between Semester II and Semester III) Approval: 19th Senate Course Contents  Module I In the first week, before leaving for field-work, students will be asked to choose a place from a list of places. These places will be pre-identified after discussion with faculty advisors. Students may propose places from their side; however, in this situation, they need to justify the place of visit in discussion with their faculty advisor (place profiling, as discussed below,may help this justification). Furthermore, in the first week, before leaving f or field-work, the students will be asked to do a soci’?/econornic/culturallgeographical profiling of the place of visit. They need to discuss their profile with their faculty advisor before they are permitted to leave for the place of visit.  Module II Students will stay at the field site during week 2-5/6. Around a 3- week period, students will be asked to send a write-up to their faculty advisor detailing their experience (based upon a diary entry) about their place of visit as well as certain unique problems in the place (they need to provide details about the problem as much as possible).  Module III Upon return from the field visit, during the final week, students will be asked to submit a field report and diary. Also, students will be asked to make a presentation on their experience and findings (they may also suggest possible solutions to the problems). A 4 credit lab course is equivalent to 8 lab hr/week during Feb-Jun or Aug-Dec semester (14 weeks under each semester).This adds up to 112 hours. Since students have to take up this Field Study Course during the Summer Term over a period of 4-6 weeks, weekly hours will be adjusted accordingly keeping the total to be 112 hrs.

In the process of RE students understand existing technologies, functions, features, objects, components and systems. By carefully disassembling, observing, testing, analyzing and reporting, students can understand how something works and suggest ways it might be improved. This process requires careful observation, disassembly, documentation, analysis and reporting. Many times, the reverse engineering process is non-destructive. This means that the object or component can be reassembled and still function just as it did before it was taken apart. Throughout the reverse engineering project, the students are able to think of ways these objects could be improved. Is there some way it could function better? or man- ufactured less expensively? The students will use observations to make suggestions for improvement of the product. Learning Topics Forward Engineering Design, Design Thought and Process, Design Steps, System RE, RE Methodology, RE Steps, System level Design, and Examples, Product Development, Product Functions, Engineering Specifications, Product Architecture, Mechanical RE, Computer-Aided RE, Electronic RE, Identify electronic components, PCB RE, Schematic Drawings and Analysis, S/W RE, Reverse Engineering in Computer Applications, Re- engineering of PLC programs.

{"text": "Course Contents In this course, using the information that has been collected and the decisions that have been made about the features, price etc. the teams will either redesign the existing prototype or design a new product based on Market feedback and create the physical product, as well as its packaging. Research at this stage usually involves repeated cycles of product improvement and testing. Product testing includes both physical performance and consumer reactions. The course looks at how a new idea becomes implemented in a system (an organization or society) and the factors that influence the adoption of a new idea. This course also looks at the influence of individuals and groups within the change process and how they affect the acceptance of new ideas. Finally, the course explores the prediction and consequences of new technologies. The end-result of these efforts is a product that meaningfully adds value to the stu- dents, faculty and society. There may be few teams working on specific components or sub systems or technology.

We will examine issues including climate change, species extinctions, agricultural practices, and pollution of soil, water, and air, both in India and throughout the globe. We will examine texts including the Vedas, the Upanis.ads, and the philosophical and narrative Yoga liter- ature. We will also introduce application of specific meditation and Yoga practices. (4 Hours )  Session Two: Pr.t.hiv¯ı S¯ukta, Earth Verses Hours: In this session we will read the Pr.t.hiv¯ı S¯ukta, the portion of the Atharva Veda that praises the earth and invites sustained reflection on the importance of a healthy ecology. Its exuberant celebra- tion of earth, water, fire, and air will be viewed through a series of photographs from all seven continents, inviting the students to participate in a viewing, a dar´sana, that breaks down barriers between self and others.

{"text": " Session Three: Sense of Place, India’s Sacred Geography Hours: Know- ing one’s eco-system, the source of one’s water and food, and the rhythm of one’s climate can be a starting point for recovering the sacred. For this session, stu- dents will be invited to reflect on their own geographic emplacement and will learn about the river, mountain, plateau, and coastal regions of India. Key texts will ground the discussion, including the horse sacrifice passage at the beginning of the Br.had¯aran.yaka Upanis.ad and the story of Satyakama Jabala in the Ch¯andogya Upanis.ad. (3 Hours)  Session Four: Yoga Ethics, Yoga and Ecology Hours: The Bhagavad-G¯ıt¯a, in its articulation of the Yogas of Action (Karma), Knowledge (J˜n¯ana), and devotion (Bhakti), provides a framework for taking up one’s work in the world (Dharma, Loka-Sa˙ngraha) for the sake of the greater good. This session explores passages that describe all three paths as ways toward ecological repair of personhood and society. The Yoga S¯utra insists upon a stabilisation of one’s ethics through the cultivation of nonviolence, truthfulness, not stealing, abstention, and minimisation of possessions. We will explore how these might be applied to current environmental difficulties. (3 Hours)  Session Five: Yogav¯asis.t.ha and Tantra Hours: We now turn our attention to how Tantra integrates bodily meditations with visualisation and mantra recitation. The Yogav¯asis.t.ha (ca. 1000 CE) includes glorious descriptions of how the goddess (Dev¯ı) dances the natural world into being. It includes descriptions of progressive meditations on the five great elements as well as encouragement to take up one’s responsibilities in the world whole-heartedly. (5 Hours)  Session Six: Animals Hours: This session explores animal stories from the Pa˜nca Tantra and the Yogav¯asis.t.ha as well as stories of Ganesha and Hanuman. Animals suffuse the landscape of India. Every god and goddess has a companion animal. Diverse species of birds, mammals, and reptiles, large and small, abound in rural and urban areas. Elephants and tigers will be discussed in light of the work of Vivek Menon of the Wildlife Trust of India. (3 Hours)  Session Seven: Eco-Activists Hours: From the time of Gandhi, a constant refrain has been sung in India: live simply so that others may live! In this session, we will look at leaders inspired by his example who continue to advocate for environmental causes starting with an examination of the lifestyle advocated by Gandhi. These will include Anil Agarwal and Sunita Narain of the Centre for Science and Environ- ment, Sunderlal Bahuguna, Vandana Shiva, and M.C. Mehta from India, and Laura Cornell, founder of the Green Yoga Association in the U.S. as well as mention of studies by scholars Pankaj Jain, George James, and David Haberman. (5 Hours)  Session Eight: Living Communities and Legislation Hours: In this final ses- sion, we will discuss eco-friendly communities including Fireflies Ashram near Ben- galuru, Navdanya near Dehradun, and Govardhan Eco-village near Mumbai as ex- amples of how the highest lifestyle values of Hinduism and Yoga are taking shape for the purpose of environmental education and uplift. We will also include a survey of legislation around the globe that seeks to infuse law with the Gandhian principles of do-no-harm and hold-to-one’s-truth.

For this reason, it is sometimes referred to as the Talavakara Upanis.ad. It forms a part of the Jaiminiya Brahman.a of the S¯ama Veda (4.18-21) but is usually regarded by Hindu authorities as a separate work.

{"text": " Kena Upanis.ad (part two): Chapter 2 is composed in verse form and presents a description of Brahman as the ultimate truth that lies behind all forms of existence. It also discusses the process of knowing Brahman as a means of attaining release from this world. (6 hours)  Kena Upanis.ad (part three): Chapters 3 and 4 adopt a narrative structure, though again the main purpose behind the discourse is the revelation of Brahman as the ultimate principle that transcends even the gods who are praised in the hymns of the Veda Samhitas. Here perhaps we get some indication of a Supreme Deity who possesses a personal identity, though this idea cannot be said to be prominent within the Kena Upanis.ad. (5 hours)  ¯I´sa Upanis.ad (part one): We move on to consider another of the most important Upanis.ads, the ¯I´sa or ¯I´s¯av¯asya, and here we have full commentaries from both an Advaitic and a Vaishnava perspective, which will provide interesting parallels. Shankaracharya has left us a full commentary on all eighteen verses, whilst Swami Prabhupada, the founder of ISKCON, made his own commentary from a Vaishnava or dualist perspective. Unit 5: ¯I´sa Upanis.ad (part two) (4 hours) This Upanis.ad seems to be about the inner Self as the ultimate principle, which can hence be referred to as God, the ¯I´sa. It is about the absolute transcendence of the Atman over the limitations that prevail in this world. And it is about moksha as the relief from suffering attained by one who can perceive the Atman. The final four verses are included to demonstrate that these ideas are not to be regarded as non-Vedic, for if one understands them properly then one can see that the Vedic hymns themselves are saying the same thing. (6 hours)  The M¯an.d. ¯ukya Upanis.ad (part one): We now consider the M¯an.d. ¯ukya Upanis.ad, which was also very highly regarded by Shankaracharya. The M¯an.d. ¯ukya Upanis.ad is significant for its revelation that the syllable ‘om’ is identical with Brahman, and today the om.k¯ara is often used to represent Hindu Dharma. Furthermore, Gauda- pada wrote an extensive treatise or K¯arik¯a on the M¯an.d. ¯ukya Upanis.ad in which we find an early exposition of the principles of Advaita Ved¯anta. (8 hours)  M¯an.d. ¯ukya Upanis.ad (part two): In this session, we will look at the final four verses of the M¯an.d. ¯ukya and then briefly consider Gaudapada’s K¯arik¯a on it, which was very influential for Shankara in his establishing the doctrines of the Advaita V¯ada.

The most widely used tests are the t- test (paired or unpaired); ANOVA (one-way non-repeated, repeated), and Pearson rank correlation.  Nonparametric: Non-parametric tests are used when continuous data are not normally distributed or when dealing with discrete variables. Most widely tests used are Chi-squared; Fisher’s exact tests; Wilcoxon’s matched pairs; Mann–Whitney U-tests; Kruskal–Wallis tests and Spearman rank correlation; Bayesian inference; Kernel Density Estimation. (15 Hours)  Laboratory/practical/tutorial Modules: The labs, using programming lan- guages like R/Python/any other, will take place over a two-hour period in alternate weeks. It will run concurrently with the theory course, thus the subjects for the lab will have previously been established in the theory session. Text books: 1.
