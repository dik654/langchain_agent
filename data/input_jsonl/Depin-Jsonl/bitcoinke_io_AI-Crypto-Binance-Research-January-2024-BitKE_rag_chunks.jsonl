{"text": "State of the Market In 2023, the public’s interest in AI saw a signiﬁcant upswing, evidenced by the marked increase in “AI” searches on Google worldwide. This heightened interest suggests a growing public engagement with AI-related topics. This surge is largely attributed to the popularity of AI chatbots, the launch of new AI tools, as well as increased media coverage and desire to learn about AI. Figure 2: Google search interest in AI saw a signiﬁcant uptick in 2023, greatly surpassing that of “Crypto” and “Bitcoin” Source: Google Trends, BinanceBitKEResearch, as of December 31, 2023 Note: Numbers represent search interest relative to the highest point on the chart for the given region and time. Conversely, the search interest for “Crypto” remained relatively stable throughout the year. It exhibited a slight downward trend from January to May, followed by a period of stability, and then experienced a minor uptick toward the end of the year. The search trends of “Bitcoin” mirrored that of “Crypto”, but with more notable fluctuations. This volatility in Bitcoin interest can be linked to the several heated narratives surrounding Bitcoin, including Ordinals/BRC-20s, potential spot ETFs, and the halving in 2024. These events contributed to an increase in Bitcoin’s price, reigniting public interest. Overall, the search trends reveal a clear divergence between the growing interest in AI and the relatively stable interest in Bitcoin and Crypto, indicating that AI has been capturing the public’s attention at an increasing rate, with no apparent signs of interest waning so far.

Despite an overall reduction in funding amounts, AI’s share of US startup funding grew by 230% in relative terms, accounting for approximately 26%.

Additionally, when considering the number of funding rounds, non-AI sectors experienced a 55% decrease, whereas the AI sector saw a 45% reduction. This comparatively smaller decline in AI funding and funding rounds indicates that investor interest in AI applications remains relatively high, despite the overall downtrend in funding amount since its peak in 2021. This could also suggest a sustained belief in the long-term potential of and viability of AI technology and applications. Additionally, the AI sector within Web3 experienced explosive growth in terms of funding in 2023. Data from Rootdata reveals a stark contrast between the collective funding amount for AI projects from 2016 to 2022, which totaled US$148.5M, and the funding amount in 2023 alone, which reached US$298M (1) .

{"text": "AI x Crypto Developments The surge in interest in AI has fueled the growth of AI-related crypto applications, paving the way for continuous innovation in the sector. In this section, we delve into some trends and tangible use cases that have emerged from the convergence of AI and crypto technologies. From powering the growth of decentralized physical infrastructure networks (“DePIN”), to the creation of more interactive consumer-facing applications, we highlight a few notable developments in this ﬁeld. AI x DePIN Large language models, deep learning, and various AI applications rely heavily on graphics processing units (“GPUs”) for computational power. However, over the past year, burgeoning interest in AI has led to an outsized demand for GPUs, leading to a shortage of chips(2) . Without easy access to GPUs, the high cost of computing can be prohibitive for researchers and start-ups doing AI-related research. This is where decentralized compute networks, a subset of DePIN come in. They provide an alternative to existing solutions dominated by centralized cloud providers and hardware manufacturers. As a result, we have also witnessed strong growth of the sector driven by demand for GPUs. Given that GPUs do not operate at 100% capacity all the time, decentralized compute networks seek to connect those with idle computing power to those who require them. This is achieved by establishing a two-sided marketplace that allows suppliers of computing power to receive incentives from the buyers. Examples of such networks include Akash, Render, Gensyn, and io.net, among others. Moreover, prices of decentralized compute networks are also competitive as there are no signiﬁcant additional costs for suppliers to provide computing power to the network.

{"text": "AI x Zero-Knowledge Smart contracts are known for their efﬁciency due to their code-based automation capabilities. However, their predeﬁned nature can sometimes lead to a lack of adaptability, particularly in unforeseen complex situations. This is where machine learning (“ML”), a subﬁeld of AI, can offer signiﬁcant improvements. ML models, trained on extensive datasets, have the ability to learn, adapt, and make highly accurate predictions. Integrating these models into smart contracts could open up a wide range of adaptable and flexible capacity. One major challenge in this integration is the exorbitant computational overhead of on-chain ML computation. This leads to the concept of Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning (\"ZKML\"). ZKML combines zero-knowledge proofs with machine learning. In this setup, ML computations are processed off-chain, while ZK proofs are used to verify the integrity of these computations without revealing the actual data. Utilizing ZKML, smart contracts can effectively leverage the power of AI while maintaining the security and transparency of blockchain technology. Figure 10: ZKML combines zero-knowledge proofs with machine learning, computing off-chain then verifying on-chain BitKE Source: Binance Research A notable development is the ZK Predictor introduced by Upshot in collaboration with Modulus Labs. This tool enables Upshot to leverage Modulus ZK circuits for verifying asset valuation without revealing proprietary intellectual property. It can be instrumental in developing Automated Market Maker (“AMM”) optimized for pricing long-tail assets, AI-driven on-chain index funds that come with on-chain cryptography proofs of their operation, or prediction market focussed on specialized topics, where the accuracy of crowd-power pricing signals can be enhanced and veriﬁed(3) . Other ZKML products include price oracle(4) . For instance, Upshot feeds its AI models with complex market data to appraise the value of long-tail assets like NFTs. Modulus’s tech then veriﬁes the correctness of these AI computations, encapsulates them in proofs, and submits them to Ethereum for ﬁnal veriﬁcation.

{"text": "These examples represent just the beginning of the myriad applications that ZKML can enable. As the tech is still in its infancy, more matured and widespread ZKML applications could be expected in the coming years. AI x Consumer dApps Over the past year, we have observed a rise of AI integration in consumer-facing decentralized applications (“dApps”) to increase interactivity and foster user participation. This trend is transforming the way users engage with platforms, offering both personalization and interactivity. By leveraging AI, such dApps empower users to shift from mere users to active participants. An example is AI user-generated content (“UGC”) platforms such as NFPrompt . As the term suggests, AI UGC refers to content created by users with the help of an autonomous system. This is broadly achieved by putting in place a set of rules that automates the output and embedding some form of randomness in the algorithm. In other words, users can input a set of rules or constraints (e.g., patterns, colors, shapes) and the AI will generate the content based on this framework. By involving users in the creation process, AI UGC platforms establish a more participatory relationship between users and the platform, while also allowing users to come up with unique, one-of-a-kind content that are inﬁnitely scalable. Figure 11: Generating a NFT using text prompts on NFPrompt BitKE Source: NFPrompt Beyond content generation, the integration of AI could have profound implications for web3 gaming or virtual worlds where in-game characters are signiﬁcantly more interactive, and conversations become more life-like.

By integrating AI into the analysis to ﬁlter out noise, more accurate data output is possible.

The end result is a more accurate depiction of market activity.
