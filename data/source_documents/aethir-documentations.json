    "content": "Aethir Network\nThe Container\nFundamental to the Aethir network, the Container is where the actual use of the cloud takes place. It acts as a virtual endpoint, executing and rendering the application (e.g., rendering the game for the player). The Container's purpose is to ensure that the cloud experience is immediate and responsive, offering a \"zero lag\" experience. This is achieved by shifting the workload from the local device to the Container (e.g., shifting all game execution and command processing).\nOperational Considerations\nContainer Status: Must always be in a ready state, prepared for immediate activation upon consumer request.\nApplication Deployment: Each Container should have the application or services pre-installed and configured to allow quick access and startup.\nProcessing Capability: Containers need to meet specific processing and graphical requirements to handle the applications or services without performance issues.\nNetwork Efficiency: Must possess the bandwidth and network infrastructure to support high-speed data transfer and low-latency interactions.\nSelection Process\nPerformance-Based: Containers are selected based on their ability to provide the highest quality of service with the lowest possible latency and cost.\nExperience Optimization: Containers are assessed for their capability to deliver the best possible consumer or enterprise application experience, considering factors such as frame rate and resolution.\nResource Provisioning\nRewards for Readiness: Containers receive compensation for maintaining a state of high readiness and for providing standby services.\nIncentives for Service: Additional rewards are given for the actual runtime during which Containers are actively used by consumers.\nQuality Assurance\nPerformance Validation: A Container's performance is regularly checked to ensure it continues to meet the network's standards.\nService Feedback: The actual user experience is monitored and used to adjust the priority and selection of Containers in the future.\nContainers States\nReady to Configure: When a Container is new, it's like it's waiting for its instructions. This is the time when it's set up with the right settings and information.\nWaiting for Check-Up: Once set up, the Container waits for a Checker to make sure everything is in order.\nChecked and Ready: If the Checker gives a thumbs up, the Container is all set to be used in the network.\nNeed Rechecking: If something's not right, the Container goes back for another check-up.\nConnected and Healthy: A Container needs to show it's well-connected and functioning correctly. This is like a regular heartbeat, showing it's alive and kicking.\nLocked for Maintenance: Sometimes, a Container needs a tune-up or an upgrade. During this time, it's not available for use.\nQuality Control: We always monitor the quality of a Container's work. If it's not up to the mark, it needs to be checked and fixed.\nDashboard\nReady for Action: Containers that have passed checks and are healthy.\nBusy Working: Containers currently in the middle of a task.\nTaking a Break: Containers that are offline or not in a healthy state.\nGetting Set Up: Containers being prepared for action.\nBilling and Usage\nActive Use: Containers that are online, healthy, and busy with tasks.\nOn Standby: Containers that are ready and waiting but not currently busy.\nFee Adjustments: In certain situations, like if a Container isn't performing well or is offline when it shouldn't be, there could be fee adjustments.\nPrevious\nAethir Network\nNext\nStaking and Rewards\nLast updated\n9 months ago"

    "content": "Aethir Staking\nStaking Key Information\nEssential ATH Staking Rewards Information\nThese are the key details regarding ATH staking rewards.\nAethir Staking Platform is on Ethereum Mainnet\nWeekly Epoch\n: Each staking epoch lasts one week. Staking epochs begin every Thursday at 00:01 UTC and last until 23:59 UTC on Wednesday next week. Wednesday 23:59 UTC is the cutoff time for that staking epoch’s rewards. If you stake your ATH on Thursday 00:01, you won’t qualify for the previous epoch’s staking rewards.\nVariable Rewards:\nThe staking rewards aren’t fixed. They vary depending on multiple factors, including the amount of staked ATH, staking duration, the total amount of ATH in the pool, and the number of users staking.\nReward power:\nThis\nis a crucial factor in determining your staking rewards. The reward power calculation is simple: Your amount of staked ATH is multiplied by the number of staking epochs in your selected lock-up period. For example, if you stake 1000 ATH for one week, your reward power score is 1. However, if you stake 1000 ATH for one year, your reward power score is 52,000 because a year has 52 weeks/epochs. The higher the reward power, the higher the staking rewards. Consequently, longer staking periods bring much higher rewards to stakers.\nClaim rewards:\nParticipants can claim rewards every Thursday, one week after staking begins. After each epoch ends on Wednesday at 23:59 UTC, users can claim the rewards from the past epoch.\nATH Staking - Frequently Asked Questions\n1. What is the minimum/maximum staking period?\nThe minimum staking period is one week, and the maximum is four years. The duration is always in whole weeks because each ATH staking epoch lasts one week.\n2. When do ATH staking epochs start and end?\nStaking starts after you click the Stake button and sign the transaction. However, the one-week staking epoch counts from every Thursday at 00:00 UTC and ends the following Wednesday at 23:59 UTC. For example, if Alice stakes on Tuesday for one week, her staking will end the following Wednesday at 23:59 UTC (a total of 8+ days).\n3. When does my stake end, and when can I withdraw my staked tokens?\nYou can withdraw your staked tokens only after your selected staking period ends. Once you choose a staking period and stake ATH, you can’t withdraw your staked tokens early. If you’ve staked ATH for one year, you can only withdraw your staked tokens after the one-year period expires.\n4. How are rewards distributed?\nATH staking rewards are distributed among users weekly, based on the amount of veATH locked, and the staking duration. This is how “APR” is calculated. Users will also earn additional tokens from Aethir ecosystem partners, calculated in the same way as ATH rewards.\n5. When can I claim rewards?\nParticipants can claim rewards every Thursday, one week after staking begins. For example, if Bob stakes his tokens on Wednesday, July 3, 2024, he will be able to claim rewards starting from Thursday, July 11, 2024. After each epoch ends on Wednesday at 23:59 UTC, users can claim the rewards from the past epoch.\n6.  How do the amount and duration of staking affect rewards?\nThe amount of staked ATH and the duration of staking determine each user's reward power, each week. Staking more ATH for a longer staking duration increases the user’s reward power and thus earns them more rewards.\n7. How does reward calculation work in practice?\nSuppose Alice stakes 100 tokens for 2 weeks, and Bob stakes 100 tokens for 4 weeks. Each week, the reward pool contains 1000 tokens. Bob's reward power will be twice that of Alice's because he chose a staking period twice as long. Thus, Bob will receive twice the rewards each week compared to Alice. Starting from the third week, Bob will receive all the rewards since he is the only staker left because Alice’s staking period has ended.\n8. How can I increase my reward power to receive more weekly rewards?\nTo increase your reward power, you can stake more ATH and/or extend the duration of your staking period.\nPrevious\nStaking User How-to Guide\nNext\nStaking Pools Emission Schedule for ATH\nLast updated\n8 months ago"

Demand-side participants looking to purchase processing power engage with node operators, compensating them in ATH for their computing power. This reflects within Aethir’s three main business models: AI applications, cloud compute, and virtualized compute.\nDiversified Application\n:\nBeyond its application in AI applications, virtualized compute, and cloud gaming, ATH finds use as the ecosystem grows. With the introduction of merge mining and integrated marketplaces, the ATH token will continue to grow in use case as the preferred means of transaction, showcasing its adaptability, relevance and future integrations, potentially giving way to a plethora of different use cases that ATH can be incorporated into.\nGovernance and Participation\n:\nFurthermore, as Aethir moves towards establishing its DAO, the ATH token takes on an additional role in governance. Token holders are empowered to propose, discuss, and vote on platform changes, ensuring that Aethir maintains its decentralized ethos.\nStaking:\nStaking is a core feature of the Aethir network, there's a few staking functions:\nFor all ATH holders, ATH staking on https://stake.aethir.com/ allows holders to actively participate in the network's operations and earn rewards. By staking your ATH tokens, you contribute to the network's security and decentralization while earning ATH.\nEdge and IDC operators are required to stake ATH to contribute compute to the network. This stake requirement incentivizes high quality of service, as those Edge and IDC node operators are providing compute. And as the compute is a live service to paying clients, the stake is needed as a deposit to slash in case SLAs are not fulfilled.\nChecker node holders are not required to stake ATH\nPrevious\nToken Vesting\nNext\nCompute Rewards\nLast updated\n8 months ago"

    "content": "Checker Guide\nHow to Manage Checker Nodes\nFAQ\nRewards\nHow are rewards calculated?\nYou can check the distribution rules\nhere\n.\nWhy were the base rewards I received significantly lower than others did?\nThe base reward is calculated based on the weighted average of the work completed correctly by each Checker. If the machine that the checker client operates on does not meet the\nminimum hardware requirements\n, licenses may go offline or produce incorrect task results, leading to reduced rewards, or even\nbanned licenses\n.\nThe rewards shown on your activity page correspond to the activities of the previous UTC day. For example, if the reward time is displayed as 2024-08-01 01:XX:XX, it represents the rewards earned between 2024-07-31 00:00:00 and 2024-07-31 23:59:59 UTC.\nIf the rewards do not meet your expectations, you may want to check the client's healthiness for that day.\nThe bonus reward is calculated based on the weighted average of the base reward received by each Checker in the quarter.\nYou can check the detailed rules for the reward distribution\nhere\n.\nWhy are my nodes checking but I can't see any rewards?\nRewards are calculated at the start of the next day and are typically reflected in your portal after 02:00 UTC the next day.\nHow can I verify whether my nodes are earning rewards for me?\nNodes are earning rewards if they are delegated, in Checking status and perform the correct result for the tasks received (therefore please make sure your node operator meets the\nminimum hardware requirements\n). Rewards are calculated and distributed daily, but the exact amount is determined at the end of the day  and typically reflected in your dashboard after 02:00 UTC.\nIf your nodes are not delegated:\nPlease\ndelegate\nyour nodes to your node operator or your checker client if you wish to run the node yourself.\nIf your nodes are delegated but in offline status\n:\nPlease check\nhere\n. You may also want to check if you have delegated to the correct Checker Client by verifying if the burner wallet shown on the owner portal is consistent with that provided by the NaaS or shown on your\nChecker Client\n.\nIf your nodes are delegated, either in ready/checking\n:\nThis means your nodes are ready to earn rewards! You can also check the questions\nhere\nand\nhere\n.\nHow can I participate in Aethir Staking using the rewards earned from my Checker nodes?\nBefore staking your rewards in Aethir Staking, you must first\nclaim and withdraw\nthem. Once withdrawn, you can proceed with the\nstaking\nprocess.\nKYC, Claim & Withdraw\nWhy does my KYC take so long to proceed?\nKYC results are typically reflected in your portal within 36 hours of submission. For any queries regarding your KYC process, please\ncontact KYC support\ndirectly. Please note it takes max. 12 hours for Aethir to proceed the KYC status after receiving Synaps approval.\nWhy did my KYC fail?\nKYC can be rejected for\na variety of reasons\n. For specific queries regarding your KYC result, please\ncontact KYC support\ndirectly. Please note it takes 1 hour for Aethir to proceed the KYC status after receiving Synaps approval.\nWhere can I find the claimed amount?\nIn the Activity page, all your claimed amount are listed under the type “Claim”.\nYou can also view the vesting period in your Dashboard or the summed up amount in your Personal Center by clicking your alias.\nOwner Portal - Dashboard > Claimed (Vesting) > View More\nI clicked “Claim” and the available vATH was reduced. But I can’t find the claimed amount.\nif your wallet window pops up and you have confirmed your claim in your wallet, please refresh the Activity page to check the status. You can also verify your transaction on\nArbiscan\n.\nif your wallet window does not pop up, or you have rejected this activity in your wallet, the transaction will shown on the Activity page as \"Pending\".  After 10 mins, the session times out, the status changes to Failed, and the amount will be returned to the claimable vATH.\nWe recommend you to use Chrome, install your wallet as a browser extension, and log into the wallet before you claim any vATH to avoid claim failure.\nIf you do not use a browser extension for the wallet, you need to open the wallet manually to confirm the claim.\nI clicked \"Claim,\" and an error message saying \"Internal JSON-RPC error\" appeared. What should I do?\nMetaMask users may encounter this error due to specific settings and configurations within MetaMask. You can try to follow the following troubleshooting guide to:\ndelete the arbitrum network and add it back manually\ncheck if there is sufficient balance for gas fee\ncheck if the Metamask app or extension is up to date.\nMetamask Support | Error 'Internal JSON-RPC error' when trying to interact with other networks\nOwner Platform & Wallet\nWhy am I seeing a message that I don’t have a license?\nAccess to the Checker Owner Portal is restricted to owners of the Checker NFT. If you see a message like “License does not exist” or “Sorry, we couldn’t find a valid Checker license in your wallet!”, try the following steps:\nStep 1: Verify your license on the Arbitrum One (ETH) Blockchain\nVisit\nArbiscan\n.\nEnter your wallet address and click Search.\nNavigate to NFT Transfers and check if Aethir Checker License(s) have been transferred to your account.\nStep 2: Troubleshoot based on your findings\nI see Aethir Checker License(s) in my wallet → Contact\nsupport\nwith your wallet ID.\nI don’t see any Aethir Checker License in my wallet → Check your purchase history and confirm you’re using the correct wallet ID.\nAdditional Possible Reason: Metastreet Participation\nIf you’ve participated in\nMetastreet\n, your license may have been transferred to the Metastreet contract, which can prevent it from appearing in your wallet.\nWhy can't I connect to my wallet extension when trying to sign-in, claim or withdraw?\nIf your wallet extension is not responding to the sign-in, claim, or withdraw requests, try the following steps:\nCheck for Updates\nEnsure your browser is up to date.\nMake sure your wallet extension is updated to the latest version.\nVerify Wallet Settings\nOpen your wallet extension and select the correct wallet.\nSwitch to the Arbitrum network.\nRetry the Connection\nAttempt to sign in/claim/withdraw again and see if the request appears.\nIf the issue persists, try the following:\nConnect to a personal hotspot.\nRefresh the page.\nTry again.\nHow do I connect my Safe wallet?\nGo to\napp.aethir.com\n. Click the button for checker node owner.\nIn the wallet selection window, choose\nWalletConnect\n.\nCopy the link provided in the WalletConnect pop-up window.\nOpen your Safe wallet. Click the WalletConnect button. Paste the link to complete the connection.\nSafe guide: How to connect a Safe to a dApp using WalletConnect\nHow do I know the burner wallet address when delegating my nodes?\nIf you decide to run the node in your own machine/VPS → Go to the\nChecker Node Client\nand get the\npublic key\nof your burner wallet\nIf you decide to use a NaaS service → Contact your NaaS provider\nWhat should I do if my nodes are in offline status?\nOffline status is typically caused by an unstable network connection of the node operator.\nScheduled maintenance\nmight also cause checker license and client to go offline.\nHow can I make my ready nodes in checking status?\nCompromised Wallet\nCan I transfer my Checker NFT to a new wallet?\nNo. Checker NFTs are non-transferable for the first year, until June 12, 2025 (stay tuned to our\nDiscord and socials\nfor more information).\nCan I transfer my Checker NFT to a new wallet if my current wallet is compromised?\nNo. Checker NFTs are non-transferable for the first year, until June 12, 2025 (stay tuned to our\nDiscord and socials\nfor more information). This means the NFT, along with any earned $vATH and vested $ATH, remains in the compromised wallet. Blockchain rules are immutable, and Aethir must follow these restrictions.\nWhat happens to my $ATH and $vATH in the compromised wallet?\n$vATH & Vested $ATH\n: $vATH is the rewards earned by the Checker nodes. Once claimed, it enters a vesting period of either 30 days or 180 days, depending on the user selection. Both\n$vATH & vested $ATH\nremain in the compromised wallet.\nWithdrawn $ATH\n: Once the vesting period ends, the $ATH can be withdrawn to the compromised wallet and then transferred to a new wallet.\nCan Aethir help recover my lost NFT or tokens?\nDue to the decentralized and annoymous nature of blockchain, Aethir cannot recover or reverse transactions involving lost or stolen assets.\nPrevious\nDashboard\nNext\nAPI for Querying License Rewards\nLast updated\n12 days ago"

Anyone who purchases a node can refer someone else by passing them their wallet address to use as a code.\nI am using a referral code for the Node Sale. What discounts do I get?\nThere are 2 types of referral codes available for use during the node sale.\nReferral Code Type\nPartner referral codes\nIndividual User referral codes\nRebate Amount to Buyer\n10%\n5%\nCommission to Referrer\nVaries\n5%\nHow to get it?\nYou can get a code from Aethir’s partners either by clicking on their official referral code links or by copying their links into the referral code field during the node sale checkout process.\nEvery buyer can have their own referral code. The wallet address you use during the node sale is your personal referral code. Users can share their wallet addresses as referral codes with other potential buyers.\nHow does it work?\nClicking on an official Aethir partner’s referral link will automatically take you to the Aethir node sale page, where you will need to confirm that you are applying the code.\nAlternatively, you can copy the code and paste it during the buying process.\nWhen someone makes a purchase with your wallet address as their referral code, you will get a 5% commission from their purchase, while they will get a 5% rebate.\nLikewise, if you use the wallet address of someone who already made a node license purchase, they will get a 5% commission and you will receive a 5% rebate.\nWhen do users receive Rebate/Commission\nThe Aethir team will process and airdrop the amount back to users two weeks after the sale. Users will receive the rebate/comission amounts in wETH\nThe Aethir team will process and airdrop the amount back to users two weeks after the sale. Users will receive the rebate/comission amounts in wETH\nWhat benefit do users get for successful referrals?\nUsers with successful referrals (users used your code to purchase a node) will receive a 5% cashback.\nWill referred users who input their friend’s wallet address as a code automatically get cashback?\nNo. A manual check will be done to verify if the referrer has actually purchased a node. Once confirmed, only then will the rebate be airdropped to the referee.\nHow will I receive my cashback?\nThe rebate you will receive is based on your total node purchase amount in wETH. After the team has verified you are holding a Checker Node during the cashback period, you will be airdropped your wETH amount.\nPrevious\nNode Sale Tiers & Whitelists\nNext\nHow to Manage Checker Nodes\nLast updated\n1 year ago"

    "content": "Checker Guide\nOperator Portal\nThe Operator Portal is a specialized platform designed for node operators to efficiently manage multiple Checker Clients at scale.\nOwner Portal v.s. Operator Portal v.s. Checker Node Client\nWhile it may be easy to confuse the Operator Portal with the Owner Portal or the Checker Node Client, they each serve distinct purposes within the Checker ecosystem.\nOwner Portal\n: This is where node owners manage their Checker Nodes. Functions include delegating, undelegating, and (in the future) transferring nodes, as well as handling rewards—such as claiming and withdrawing earned vATH/ATH.\nChecker Node Client\n: This is the software that runs the nodes. It handles delegation requests and ensures that the machine stays online to perform the computational tasks required by Checker Nodes.\nBoth the\nOwner Portal\nand\nChecker Node Client\nare\nessential\ncomponents of the Checker lifecycle. As a node owner, you should always have access to the Owner Portal to manage your nodes as assets. The Checker Node Client can either be run by you or by others (such as node operators, whether friends or a Node-as-a-Service provider).\nIn contrast, the\nOperator Portal\nis an\noptional\ntool designed to simplify the work of operators monitoring multiple Checker Node Clients. It helps ensure that delegation requests are approved or rejected in a timely manner and that all machines are running smoothly. However, it is not essential to the basic functioning of Checker Nodes—you can choose not to use it without impacting normal node operations.\nWe only recommend using the Operator Portal when you run multiple Checker Node Clients or with justified reasons, to avoid confusion among platforms.\nPrevious\nAPI for Querying Client Status\nNext\nConnect Wallet\nLast updated\n6 months ago"

Burner Wallet Registration Flow\n:\nA new burner wallet address will not be registered in the Checker System, until an owner delegates to that address. While there is no difference in your user experience, you now cannot establish websocket connection to the Checker System.\nSo, if you created a new burner wallet, you must wait for a license owner to initiate the delegation flow before your checker client can establish a connection to the Checker System. This process may take\nup to 5 minutes\non the backend. Please note, there is now a rate limit on the register endpoint, allowing one request per minute per IP.

    "content": "Checker Guide\nWhat is the Checker Node\nA Checker Node is one of the three fundamental components of the Aethir Network backend infrastructure:\nContainers:\nFundamental to the Aethir network, the Container is where the actual use of the cloud takes place. It acts as a virtual endpoint, executing and rendering the application (e.g., rendering the game for a player, executing an inference task for an AI consumer, powering a virtual phone). The Container's purpose is to ensure that the cloud experience is immediate and responsive, offering a \"zero lag\" experience. This is achieved by shifting the workload from the local device to the Container (e.g., shifting all game execution and command processing).\nCheckers:\nThe Checker ensures the integrity and performance of Containers within the Aethir network. Verifying container specifications as provided by the Container Providers is essential to maintain the network's Quality of Service (QoS).\nIndexers:\nCore to Aethir’s network, the Indexer matches consumers with suitable Containers, ensuring a swift launch of cloud-based apps & services. The goal is to deliver a “second on” service - the transition from a consumer’s request to the actual delivery (e.g. a player making a request to a game screen) should occur in the shortest possible time. This requires succinct signaling and efficient scheduling.\nPrevious\nChecker Guide\nNext\nHow do Checker Nodes Work\nLast updated\n8 months ago"

    "content": "Staking and Rewards for Cloud Host (Compute Providers)\nSlashing Mechanism\nSlashing Mechanism\nSlashing\nis a penalty mechanism designed to ensure the reliability and security of the Aethir network. It discourages malicious behavior and container downtime by reducing the staking amount of the container and temporarily halting its operation until the stake is replenished.\nFor any container that meets slashing conditions, rewards will first be slashed, followed by stake amount.\nThe slashing mechanism is implemented for several key reasons:\nIncentivizing Reliability: It encourages GPU nodes to maintain high uptime and reliable performance. By imposing penalties for downtime, it promotes accountability among node operators.\nNetwork Security: Slashing helps protect the network from malicious actors. If a node behaves dishonestly or fails to perform its duties, slashing acts as a deterrent against such behavior.\nFairness in Resource Allocation: It ensures that resources are allocated efficiently. Nodes that consistently perform poorly may lose their stake, allowing better-performing nodes to take their place.\nEncouraging Compliance: By penalizing non-compliance with the network's rules or performance standards, slashing ensures that all participants adhere to the agreed-upon protocols, maintaining the integrity of the system.\nEconomic Stability: Slashing can help stabilize the token economy by reducing the number of poorly performing nodes, which can lead to a healthier overall ecosystem.\nOffline Slashing Penalty:\nAethir network collects \"heartbeat\" messages from GPU Nodes every minute. If a node fails to send these messages, it is considered offline. Messages are sent via the Aethir agent running on the bare metal server. It is the Cloud Host’s responsibility to ensure Aethir agents don’t get deleted or terminated on the server, as it may result in inaccurate status reports.\nDaily Offline Rate: is the cumulative offline time calculated at the end of each day 23:59:59 UTC.\nMonthly Uptime Rate: is the cumulative uptime calculated at the end of the order (if the order period is less than 30 days) or every 30 days after the order takes effect;\nNon-order period: No slashing will occur if your GPU node is not reserved by tenants. You will however lose out on Proof of Capacity rewards when you are offline.\nSlashing Types:\nDaily Slashing\nIf your “Daily Offline Rate” is greater than 30 minutes , you will lose out on the Service Fee for the day.\nIf your “Daily Offline Rate” is greater than 60 minutes, you will lose out on the Proof of Capacity and Proof of Delivery rewards for the day.\nMonthly Slashing\n“Monthly Uptime Rate (MUR)” is used to determine the amount of Penalty Notice for each slashing occurrence.\n“Penalty Notice (PN)” is a formal notification issued to a node or participant, indicating that they have violated the SLA agreement. This notice details the associated fine, which requires the recipient to pay back within 30 days.\n95% <= MUR < 99%: 10% Service fee as PN\n90% <= MUR < 95%: 30% Service fee as PN\n80% <= MUR < 90%: 50% Service fee + ⅓ current Staking Fee as PN\n70% <= MUR < 80%: 50% Service fee + ⅔ current Staking Fee as PN\nMUR < 70%: 100% Service fee + 100% current Staking Fee as PN and order is terminated.\nDaily Slashing and Monthly Slashing can stack.\nThe Cloud Host has 3 calendar days to appeal the penalty.\nSpec Mismatching Slashing Penalty:\nIf a resource’s performance is lower than the spec it declares when initially onboarded into Aethir, the resource will be penalized 100% of its original staking fee, order terminated and taken offline, with a 3-day appeal period.\nPenalty Notice Rules:\nSlashed amount will be transferred to a “compensation” pool, which is used to compensate Aethir Tenants, for interrupted cloud services based on SLAs.\n“Penalty Notice” can be paid with vested service fees or rewards, or direct deposit of ATH.\nPending penalty will result in inability to unstake, or claim service fees or rewards.\nIf the accumulated unpaid penalty amount exceeds the resource’s staking amount, it will be taken offline. When the host settles all penalties, the resource will automatically return to \"In Service\" status.\nIf unpaid penalties are pending for more than 30 days, Aethir reserves the right to transfer the equivalent amount of your pending penalty, from your host account’s ATH balance, into the “compensation” pool. The order of deduction is service fee > reward > staking fee. If there is still remaining compensation that needs to be made to tenants, then the “compensation” pool will cover the rest.\nPrevious\nService Fees\nNext\nKey Terms and Concepts\nLast updated\n1 month ago"

These Terms, your access to and use of the Services and Content, and your participation in the Services, shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of Singapore, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles of Singapore, or any other jurisdiction that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Any dispute between the parties that is not subject to arbitration or cannot be heard in court located in Singapore.\n10.2 Severability. If any provision of these Terms or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid or unenforceable to any extent, the remainder of these Terms and the application of that provision to other persons or circumstances is not affected thereby, and that provision will be enforced to the greatest extent permitted by applicable laws.\n10.3 Waiver. No waiver of any right under these Terms will be of any effect or binding upon anyone unless such waiver is in writing and is signed by an authorized representative of the party so waiving such right. No delay or failure of any party in exercising any right hereunder and no partial or single exercise of any such right will be deemed of itself to constitute a waiver of such right or other rights hereunder.\n10.4 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. The provisions hereof are solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to, and will not be construed to, confer a right or benefit on any other person.\n10.5 Assignment. You shall not assign or transfer (whether by operation of law or otherwise) these Terms (or any rights or obligations hereunder) to a third party.\n10.6 Force Majeure. No party will be held liable or responsible to any other party nor be deemed to have breached these Terms for failure or delay in fulfilling or performing any provision hereunder when such failure or delay results from causes beyond the reasonable control of the affected party, which may include embargoes, acts of war (whether declared or not), insurrections, riots, civil commotions, acts of terrorism, strikes, lockouts or other labor disturbances, pandemics, epidemics or acts of God (a “Force Majeure Event”). The affected party will notify the other parties of such Force Majeure Event as soon as reasonably practical and will make every reasonable effort to mitigate the effects of such Force Majeure Event.\n10.7 External Sites and Third-Party Content. The Website may contain links to third-party websites or content (“External Sites”). Such External Sites are provided solely as a convenience to you and not as an endorsement by us of the content on such External Sites. The content of such External Sites is developed and provided by others. You should contact the site administrator or webmaster for those External Sites if you have any concerns regarding such links or any content located on such External Sites. We are not responsible for the content of any linked External Sites and do not make any representations regarding the content or accuracy of materials on such External Sites. You should take precautions when (i) interacting with such External Sites, or (ii) downloading files from all websites to protect your computer from viruses and other destructive programs.

This Section includes an arbitration agreement and an agreement that all claims will be brought only in an individual capacity (and not as a class action or other representative proceeding). Please read it carefully.\n(i) Informal Process. You agree that in the event of any dispute between you and Aethir, you will first contact Aethir and make a good faith sustained effort to resolve the dispute before resorting to more formal means of resolution, including without limitation any court action.\n(ii) Agreement to Arbitrate. Any dispute arising out of or in connection with these Terms, including any question regarding its existence, validity or termination, shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration administered by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC”) in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC Rules”) for the time being in force, which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference in this clause. The seat of the arbitration shall be Singapore. The Tribunal shall consist of 1 arbitrator. The language of the arbitration shall be English.\n10.9 Class Action Waiver. Any Claim must be brought in the respective party’s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, representative, multiple plaintiff or similar proceeding (“Class Action”). The parties expressly waive any ability to maintain any Class Action in any forum. If the Claim is subject to arbitration, the arbitrator will not have authority to combine or aggregate similar claims or conduct any Class Action nor make an award to any person or entity not a party to the arbitration. Any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The parties understand that any right to litigate in court, to have a judge or jury decide their case or to be a party to a class or representative action is waived, and that any claims must be decided individually, through arbitration.\n(i) Waiver of Jury Trial. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you and Aethir each waive any right to a jury trial.\nPrevious\nAethir General Terms of Service\nNext\nAirdrop Terms of Service\nLast updated\n10 months ago"
